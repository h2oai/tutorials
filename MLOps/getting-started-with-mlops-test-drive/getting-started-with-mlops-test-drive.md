## MLOps Test Drive

**MLOps Test Drive** is a two-hour lab session that exists in H2O's Aquarium. Aquarium is the H2O.ai cloud environment providing software access for workshops, conferences, and training.

If you are new to **MLOps**, we highly recommend finishing this short self-paced course to set up your MLOps Test Drive

**All MLOps Test Drive Lab sessions will terminate after two-hours. No work will be saved!**. However, you can retake the lab multiple times.

**Note**: **Aquarium’s MLOps Test Drive lab has a license key built-in, so you don’t need to request one to use it**.
