        <p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that tries to identify and extract opinions from a given text. Sentiment analysis aims to gauge the attitudes, sentiments, and emotions of a speaker/writer based on the computational treatment of subjectivity in a text. This can be in the form of like/dislike binary rating or in the form of numerical ratings from 1 to 5.</p>

<p>Sentiment Analysis is an important sub-field of NLP. It can help to create targeted brand messages and assist a company in understanding consumer&#39;s preferences. These insights could be critical for a company to increase its reach and influence across a range of sectors.</p>
<p>Here are some of the uses of Sentiment Analysis from a business perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide audience insight</li>
<li>Support customer Service</li>
<li>Augments good PR practices</li>
<li>Drive proactive business solutions</li>
<li>Measure the ROI of the marketing campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>In this self-paced course, we will learn some core NLP concepts that will enable us to build and understand an NLP model capable of classifying fine food reviews from Amazon customers. In other words, we will conduct a <strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong> on the various customer reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is highly recommended that you go over the entire self-paced course before starting the experiment.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>About the Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. The data spans a period of more than 10 years, from Oct 1999 up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories[1]. The data consists of 568,454 reviews, 256,059 users, 74,258 products and 260 users with &gt; 50 reviews.</p>
<p>Our aim is to study these reviews and try and predict whether a review is positive or negative.</p>
<p>The data has been originally hosted by SNAP (<a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html" target="_blank">Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection</a>), a collection of more than 50 large network datasets. In includes social networks, web graphs, road networks, internet networks, citation networks, collaboration networks, and communication networks [2].</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Dataset Overview</h2>
<p>In <strong>Aquarium</strong>, the <strong>Driverless AI Test Drive</strong> instance has the <strong>Amazon fine food review</strong> dataset already and has been split for this self-paced course&#39;s experiment. The split resulted in a train and test dataset. The datasets can be located on the Datasets overview page. However, you can also upload the datasets externally. To learn more about how to add the dataset please consult <a href="#appendix-a-add-the-datasets" target="_blank">Appendix A: Add the Dataset</a>.</p>
<p>1. In the <strong>Datasets</strong> overview page, observe the two datasets we will use for this self-paced course:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="datasets-overview" src="img/d1a5c0b9b8b1ad0b.jpg"></p>
<p>2. Click the following dataset and right after select the <strong>Details</strong> option: <code>AmazonFineFoodReviews_train...</code>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dataset-details" src="img/1d374e1765e7f58d.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Let&#39;s take a quick look at the columns of the training dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dataset consists of 11 columns which are as follows:<br><img alt="dataset-columns-info-1" src="img/14fb2f7152dede58.jpg"><strong>a</strong>. <strong>UserId</strong> - unique identifier for the user<br><strong>b</strong>. <strong>ProductId</strong> - unique identifier for the product<br><strong>c</strong>. <strong>Id</strong> - review ID<br><strong>d</strong>. <strong>Summary</strong> - brief summary of the review<br><strong>e</strong>. <strong>Score</strong> - rating between 1 and 5<br><strong>f</strong>. <strong>HelpfulnessDenominator</strong> - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not<br><strong>g</strong>. <strong>ProfileName</strong> - profile name of the user<br></li>
<li>Continue scrolling to the right of the page to see more columns (image is not included):<br><img alt="dataset-columns-info-2" src="img/81983a360a87e012.jpg"><strong>h</strong>. <strong>HelpfulnessNumerator</strong> - number of users who found the review helpful<br><strong>i</strong>. <strong>Time</strong> - timestamp for the review<br><strong>j</strong>. <strong>Description</strong> - text of the review<br><strong>k</strong>. <strong>Positive Review</strong> - whether the review is Positive or Negative</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Return to the Datasets page.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Launch Experiment</h2>
<p>The experiment has already been pre-built, given that it takes more than two hours for the experiment to complete. Below you will be guided on how to access the pre-built experiment right before we start our analysis on the built NLP model&#39;s effectiveness. For now, consider the intructions below if you were to build the experiment from scratch:</p>
<p>1. In the <strong>Datasets</strong> page, click on the following dataset, and right after select the <strong>Predict</strong> option: <code>AmazonFineFoodReviews-train-26k.csv</code>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="launch-experiment" src="img/c476a1250e3b2a3.jpg"></p>
<p>2. As soon as you select the <strong>Predict</strong> option, you are asked if you want to take a tour of the Driverless AI environment. Skip it for now by clicking <strong>Not Now</strong>. The following will appear:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="initial-experiment-overview" src="img/d7fe665c4136aafa.jpg"></p>
<p>3. Next, you will need to feed in the following information into Driverless AI:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="name-experiment" src="img/91de9c6f60f9beeb.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Things to Note</strong>:<br><strong>a</strong>. <strong>Display Name</strong> - Let&#39;s name our current experiment <code>Sentiment Analysis</code>.<br><strong>b</strong>. <strong>Target Column</strong> -  Select <strong>PositiveReview</strong> as the target column. The aim of the experiment is to try to predict whether a given review is positive or negative, hence the <strong>PositiveReview</strong> is selected as the target column. The column has only two values i.e Positive and Negative:<br>  <img alt="target-column" src="img/3eacc61944092957.jpg"><strong>c</strong>. <strong>Dropped Columns</strong> - For this experiment, only text columns are selected, and therefore we shall only use the text columns, so we drop all columns that are not in a text format (<strong>do not drop the </strong><strong><em>Description</em></strong><strong> column</strong>):<br>  <img alt="dropped-columns" src="img/5d2e4a7c69eb5a03.jpg">  <ul>
<li>However, please note that if you decide to keep the non-text columns, the NLP algorithms will still work on the non-text columns.<br><strong>d</strong>. <strong>Test Dataset</strong> -  The <em>Test dataset</em> is a dataset used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a <em>final</em> model fit on the training dataset. It is not used during training of the model. Therefore, select the following dataset for the test dataset option: <code>AmazonFineFoodReviews-test-26k.csv</code>:<br><img alt="test-dataset" src="img/ec9b7d9c9689d29d.jpg"></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, your experiment preview page will similarly look as follows:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="final-experiment-screen" src="img/a6a89c6c1199df81.jpg"></p>
<p>In <strong>Task 2</strong>, we will continue editing our experiment settings.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: Training Settings" duration="0">
        <p>This task deals with settings that will enable us to run an effective NLP experiment. Let us now understand such settings and let&#39;s adjust them accurately:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="experiment-settings" src="img/c9801e53f930a36e.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Things to Note</strong>:<br>  <strong>a</strong>. <strong>Accuracy</strong> - accuracy stands for relative accuracy, i.e., higher values should lead to higher confidence in model performance (accuracy): the accuracy setting impacts which algorithms are considered, level of assembling, and types of feature engineering.<br>  <ul>
<li>Therefore, set the <strong>Accuracy</strong> value to <strong>5</strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>b</strong>. <strong>Time</strong> - time is the relative time for completing the experiment. Higher values will lead to experiments taking longer.<br>  <ul>
<li>Therefore, set the <strong>Time</strong> value to <strong>2<br></strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>c</strong>. <strong>Interpretability</strong> - interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of the decision. It controls the complexity of the models and features allowed within the experiments (e.g., higher interpretability will generally block complicated features, feature engineering, and models).<br>  <ul>
<li>Therefore, set the <strong>Interpretability</strong> value to <strong>5</strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>d</strong>. <strong>Scorer</strong> - the scorer is the metric used to evaluate the machine learning algorithm. The scorer used for this experiment is the LogLoss or logarithmic loss metric, which is used to evaluate the performance of a binomial or multinomial classifier. Unlike AUC, which looks at how well a model can classify a binary target, log loss evaluates how close a model&#39;s predicted values (uncalibrated probability estimates) are to the actual target value. The lower the Logloss value, the better the model can predict the sentiment.<br>  <ul>
<li>Therefore, set the <strong>scorer</strong> to <strong>LOGLOSS</strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>e</strong>. <strong>Expert Settings</strong> - several configurable settings are available for NLP experiments in Driverless AI, which can be tuned according to the experiment type. To tune the NLP settings, click on the <strong>Expert Settings</strong>, and navigate to the NLP tab:  <img alt="nlp-expert-settings" src="img/aee53dc6f54713f1.jpg">  <ul>
<li>In the NLP tab, note the following particular settings that users  can use for any NLP experiment:<br></li>
</ul>
  <strong>a</strong>. <strong>Word-Based CNN TensorFlow Models for NLP</strong>:<br>  Specify whether to use Word-based CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) TensorFlow models for NLP. This option is ignored if TensorFlow is disabled. We recommend that you disable this option on systems that do not use GPUs.<br>  <ul>
<li>For this experiment set this setting <strong>ON<br></strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>b</strong>. <strong>Word-Based BiGRU TensorFlow Models for NLP</strong>:<br>  Specify whether to use Word-based BiGRU TensorFlow models for NLP. This option is ignored if TensorFlow is disabled. We recommend that you disable this option on systems that do not use GPUs.<br>  <ul>
<li>For this experiment set this setting <strong>OFF</strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>c</strong>. <strong>Character-Based CNN TensorFlow Models for NLP</strong>:<br>  Specify whether to use Character-level CNN TensorFlow models for NLP. This option is ignored if TensorFlow is disabled. We recommend that you disable this option on systems that do not use GPUs.<br>  <ul>
<li>For this experiment set this setting <strong>ON</strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>d</strong>. <strong>PyTorch Models for NLP (Experimental)</strong>:<br>  Specify whether to enable pre-trained PyTorch models and fine-tune them for NLP tasks. This is set to Auto by default. You need to set this to On if you want to use the PyTorch models like BERT for feature engineering or for modeling. We recommend that you use GPUs to speed up execution when this option is used.<br>  <ul>
<li>For this experiment set this setting to <strong>AUTO</strong></li>
</ul>
  <strong>e</strong>. <strong>Select which pretrained PyTorch NLP Model(s) to use</strong>:<br>  This setting is to be used if you enable the Pytorch Models. When you click on the <strong>Select which pretrained PyTorch NLP Model(s) to use</strong> you can specify one or more pretrained PyTorch NLP models to use from the following list:<br>  <ul>
<li>bert-base-uncased</li>
<li>distillery-base-uncased</li>
<li>xlnet-base-cased</li>
<li>xlm-mlm-enfr-1024</li>
<li>roberta-base</li>
<li>Albert-base-v2</li>
<li>camembert-base</li>
<li>xlm-roberta-base<br></li>
</ul>
  This setting requires an Internet connection. Using BERT-like models may result in a longer experiment completion time. We will change nothing from this setting.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additionally, there are three more buttons located beneath the experimental settings knob which stand for the following:  <ul>
<li><strong>Classification or Regression</strong>: Driverless AI automatically determines the problem type based on the response column. Though not recommended, you can override this setting by clicking this button. Our current problem is that of Classification.  <ul>
<li>Make sure this setting is set to <strong>Classification</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reproducible</strong>: This button allows you to build an experiment with a random seed and get reproducible results. If this is disabled (default), the results will vary between runs.  <ul>
<li>Don&#39;t enable this setting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GPUS Enable</strong>: Specify whether to enable GPUs. (Note that this option is ignored on CPU-only systems).  <ul>
<li>Make sure this setting is enable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We selected the above settings to generate a model with sufficient accuracy in the <strong>H2O Driverless AI Test Drive environment</strong>. At this point, your experiment pre-view page should similarly look as follows:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="final-experiment-launch" src="img/748f14d513cc6ef1.jpg"></p>
<p>The amount of time this experiment will take to complete will depend on on the memory, availability of GPU in a system, and the expert settings a user might select. If the system does not have a GPU, it might run for a longer time. You can Launch the Experiment and wait for it to finish, or you can access a pre-build version in the <strong>Experiment</strong> section. After discussing few NLP concepts in the upcoming two tasks, we will discuss how to access this pre-built experiment right before analyzing its performance.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 3: Natural Language Processing Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
<p>NLP is the field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. NLP sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics[1]. NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic tagging of incoming customer queries related to credit card, loans, etc</li>
<li>Sentiment analysis of social media reviews</li>
<li>Using free text variables along with numeric variables for credit risk and fraud models</li>
<li>Emotion detection</li>
<li>Profanity detection</li>
</ul>
<p>The text data is highly unstructured, but the Machine learning algorithms usually work with numeric input features. So before we start with any NLP project, we need to pre-process and normalize the text to make it ideal for feeding into the commonly available Machine learning algorithms. This essentially means we need to build a pipeline of some sort that breaks down the problem into several pieces. We can then apply various methodologies to these pieces and plug the solution together in a pipeline.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Building a Typical NLP Pipeline</h2>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="nlp-pipeline" src="img/97b29e2b1deef178.jpg"></p>
<p>The figure above shows how a typical pipeline looks. It is also important to note that there may be variations depending upon the problem at hand. Hence the pipeline will have to be adjusted to suit our needs. Driverless AI automates the above process. Let&#39;s try and understand some of the components of the pipeline in brief:</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Text preprocessing</h2>
<p>Text pre-processing involves using various techniques to convert raw text into well-defined sequences of linguistic components with standard structure and notation. Some of those techniques are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentence Segmentation:</strong> involves identifying sentence boundaries between words in different sentences. Since most written languages have punctuation marks that occur at sentence boundaries, sentence segmentation is frequently referred to as sentence boundary detection, sentence boundary disambiguation, or sentence boundary recognition. All these terms refer to the same task: determining how a text should be divided into sentences for further processing.</li>
<li><strong>Text Tokenization:</strong> Tokenization involves splitting raw text corpus into sentences and then further splitting each sentence into words.</li>
<li><strong>Text Standardisation:</strong> Once the text has been tokenized, it is normalized by getting rid of the noise. Noise relates to anything that isn&#39;t in a standard format like punctuation marks, special characters, or unwanted tokens. If required, case conversions can also be done, i.e., converting all tokens into either lowercase or uppercase.</li>
<li><strong>Removing Stopwords:</strong> Stop words are words that appear very frequently in a text like &#34;and&#34;, &#34;the&#34;, and &#34;a&#34;, but appear to be of little value in helping select documents. Therefore, such words are excluded from the vocabulary entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Stemming:</strong> Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base, or root form — generally a written word form. For example: if we were to stem the following words: &#34;Stems,&#34; &#34;Stemming,&#34; &#34;Stemmed,&#34; &#34;and &#34;Stemtization,&#34; the result would be a single token &#34;stem.&#34;</li>
<li><strong>Lemmatization:</strong> a similar operation to Stemming is Lemmatization. However, the major difference between the two is that Stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas Lemmatization creates actual words. An example of Lemmatization: &#34;run&#34; is a base form for words like &#34;running&#34; or &#34;ran,&#34; and the word &#34;better&#34; and &#34;good&#34; are in the same lemma, so they are considered the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note here that the above steps are not mandatory, and their usage depends upon the use case. For instance, in sentiment analysis, emoticons signify polarity, and stripping them off from the text may not be a good idea. The general goal of Normalization, Stemming, and Lemmatization techniques is to improve the model&#39;s generalization. Essentially we are mapping different variants of what we consider to be the same or very similar &#34;word&#34; to one token in our data.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Feature Extraction</h2>
<p>The Machine Learning Algorithms usually expect features in the form of numeric vectors. Hence, after the initial preprocessing phase, we need to transform the text into a meaningful vector (or array) of numbers. This process is called <strong>feature extraction</strong>. Let&#39;s see how some of the feature-extracting techniques work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bag of Words (BoW):</strong> The bag-of-words represents text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:  <ul>
<li>A vocabulary of known words</li>
<li>A measure of the presence of known words</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have identical content, and we can get an idea about the meaning of the document from its content alone.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Example implementation</h2>
<p>The following models a text document using bag-of-words here are two simple text documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.</li>
<li>John also likes to watch football games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these two text documents, a list is constructed as follows for each document:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;John&#34;, &#34;likes&#34; ,&#34;to&#34; ,&#34;watch&#34; ,&#34;movies&#34; ,&#34;Mary&#34; ,&#34;likes&#34;,&#34;movies&#34; ,&#34;too&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;John&#34; ,&#34;also&#34; ,&#34;likes&#34; ,&#34;to&#34; ,&#34;watch&#34; ,&#34;football&#34; ,&#34;games&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>Representing each bag-of-words as a JSON object and attributing to the respective JavaScript variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>BoW1 = {&#34;John&#34;:1, &#34;likes&#34;:2, &#34;to&#34;:1, &#34;watch&#34;:1 ,&#34;movies&#34;:2 ,&#34;Mary&#34;:1 ,&#34;too&#34;:1};</li>
<li>BoW2 = {&#34;John&#34;:1, &#34;also&#34;:1, &#34;likes&#34;:1, &#34;to&#34;:1, &#34;watch&#34;:1, &#34;football&#34;:1, &#34;games&#34;:1};</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that <strong>BoW</strong> does not retain word order and is sensitive towards document length, i.e., token frequency counts could be higher for longer documents.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create <strong>BoW</strong> models with consecutive words, also known as <strong>n-grams</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TF-IDF Model:</strong> A problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g., larger score) but may not contain as much &#34;informational content.&#34; Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter ones. One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words across all documents are penalized. This approach of scoring is called <strong>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</strong>, or TF-IDF [2] for short, where:  <ul>
<li><strong>Term Frequency</strong> is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document. TF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)</li>
<li><strong>Inverse Document Frequency</strong>: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents. IDF = 1+log(N/n), where <strong>N</strong> is the number of documents, and <strong>n</strong> is the number of documents a term <strong>t</strong> has appeared. TF-IDF weight is often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus:</li>
</ul>
  <img alt="tfidf" src="img/dcfd44a9173da5dd.jpg"></li>
</ul>
<p>The dimensions of the output vectors are high. This also gives importance to the rare terms that occur in the corpus, which might help our classification tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong>:  Principal Component Analysis is a dimension reduction tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the original set.</li>
<li><strong>Truncated SVD</strong>:  SVD stands for Singular Value Decomposition[3], which is a way to decompose matrices. Truncated SVD is a common method to reduce the dimension for text-based frequency/vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Word Vectorization Models</strong>:  TFIDF and frequency-based models represent counts and significant word information, but they lack semantics of the words in general. One of the popular representations of text to overcome this is <strong>Word Embeddings</strong>.  Word embeddings is a feature engineering technique for text where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. There are ways to create more advanced word vectorization models for extracting features from text data like word2vec[2] model. The word2vec model was released in 2013 by Google; word2vec is a neural network-based implementation that learns distributed vector representations of words based on continuous <strong>Bag of Words</strong> and skip-gram–based architectures.  <img alt="word-vectors" src="img/778c1b0e9843a293.jpg">  Representations are made so that words that have similar meanings are placed close or equidistant to each other. For example, a word like <strong>king</strong> is closely associated with <strong>queen</strong> in this vector representation.</li>
<li><strong>Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Models on Word Embeddings</strong>:  CNN&#39;s are generally used in computer vision; however, they&#39;ve recently been applied on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks, and the results were promising[5].  Word embeddings can be passed as inputs to CNN models, and cross-validated predictions are obtained from them. These predictions can then be used as a new set of features.  <img alt="cnn" src="img/8e699b7fc8d1334a.jpg">    Figure 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for sentence classification  </li>
<li><strong>Recurrent neural networks</strong>  RNNs like LSTM and GRU are state-of-the-art algorithms for NLP problems.  A Bi-directional GRU model is putting two independent RNN models in one.  For example, in the sentence &#34;John is walking on the golf court,&#34; a unidirectional model would represent states representing &#34;golf&#34; based on &#34;John is walking&#34; but not the &#34;court.&#34;  In a bi-directional model, the representation would also account for the later representations giving the model more predictive power. This makes it a more natural approach when dealing with textual data since the text is naturally sequential[6].  <img alt="rnn" src="img/79849e34d9233bc1.jpg">    Figure 2. Standard Sequence to Sequence Model.  </li>
<li><strong>Transformer based language models</strong>  Transformer-based language models like BERT are state-of-the-art NLP models that can be used for a wide variety of NLP tasks. These models capture the contextual relation between words by using an attention mechanism. Unlike directional models that read text sequentially, a Transformer-based model reads the entire sequence of text at once, allowing it to learn the word&#39;s context based on all of its surrounding words. The embeddings obtained by these models show improved results in comparison to earlier embedding approaches.    <img style="width: 370.00px" src="img/c658ca69e7464e68.jpg">  Figure 3. BERT  </li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 4: Driverless AI NLP Recipe" duration="0">
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>This section will discuss all current NLP model capabilities of Driverless AI. Keep in mind that not all settings discussed below have been enabled in the current sentiment analysis experiment.</em></p>
<p>Text data can contain critical information to inform better predictions. Driverless AI automatically converts text strings into features using powerful techniques like TFIDF, CNN, and GRU. Driverless AI now also includes state-of-the-art PyTorch BERT transformers. With advanced NLP techniques, Driverless AI can also process larger text blocks, build models using all available data, and solve business problems like sentiment analysis, document classification, and content tagging.</p>
<p>The Driverless AI platform can support both standalone text and text with other columns as predictive features. In particular, the following NLP recipes are available for a given text column:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="driverless-nlp-recipe" src="img/46a2a23e473e6343.jpg"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Key Capabilities of Driverless AI NLP Recipes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>N-grams</strong>:  <ul>
<li>An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of <strong>n</strong> items from a given text or speech sample.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>TFIDF of n-grams</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Frequency-based features can be multiplied with the inverse document frequency to get term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectors. Doing so also gives importance to the rare terms in the corpus, which can help in specific classification tasks. <img alt="ngram_tfidf" src="img/b08697c83f18017e.png"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Frequency of n-grams</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Frequency-based features represent the count of each word in the given text in the form of vectors. Frequency-based features are created for different n-gram values[2]. The dimensions of the output vectors are quite high. Words and n-grams that occur more times will get higher weightage than the ones that occur less frequently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Truncated SVD Features</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Both TFIDF and Frequency of n-grams result in a higher dimension. To tackle this, we use Truncated SVD to decompose the vector arrays in lower dimensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Linear models on TF/IDF vectors</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Our NLP recipe also has linear models on top of n-gram TFIDF/ frequency vectors. This captures linear dependencies that are simple yet significant in achieving the best accuracies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Word Embeddings</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Driverless AI NLP recipe uses the power of word embeddings where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bi-direction GRU models on Word Embeddings (TensorFlow)</strong>:  <ul>
<li>A BI-directional GRU model is like putting independent RNN models in one. GRU gives higher speed and almost similar accuracy when compared to its counterpart LSTM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Convolution neural network models on:  </strong><ul>
<li><strong>Word embeddings followed by CNN model (TensorFlow)</strong>:  <ul>
<li>In Driverless AI, we pass word embeddings as input to CNN models; we get cross-validated predictions from it and use them as a new set of features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Character embeddings followed by CNN model (TensorFlow)</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Natural language processing is complex as the language is hard to understand given small data and different languages. Targeting languages like Japanese, Chinese where characters play a major role, we have character level embeddings in our recipe as well.</li>
<li>In character embeddings, each character gets represented in the form of vectors rather than words. Driverless AI uses character level embeddings as input to CNN models and later extracts class probabilities to feed as features for downstream models: this gives the ability to work in languages other than English. In languages like Japanese and Chinese, where there is no concept of words, character embeddings will be useful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BERT/DistilBERT based embeddings for Feature Engineering (PyTorch):  </strong><ul>
<li>BERT and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108" target="_blank">DistilBERT</a> models can be used to generate embeddings for any text columns. These pre-trained models are used to get embeddings for the text, followed by Linear/Logistic Regression to generate features that Driverless AI  can then use for any downstream models in Driverless AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PyTorch Transformer Architecture Models (e.g., BERT) as Modeling Algorithms:  </strong><ul>
<li>With versions of  Driverless AI 1.9 and higher, the Transformer-based architectures shown in the diagram below are supported as models in Driverless AI: <img alt="bert-models" src="img/9336607e1eba5b0d.jpg"></li>
<li>The BERT model supports multiple languages. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108" target="_blank">DistilBERT</a> is a distilled version of BERT that has fewer parameters compared to BERT (40% less), and it is faster (60% speedup) while retaining 95% of BERT level performance. The DistilBERT model can be helpful when training time and model size is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Domain Specific BERT Recipes</strong>  Driverless AI can also extend the DAI Base BERT model for domain-specific problems:  <ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ProsusAI/finBERT" target="_blank">FinBERT</a> (trained on financial text)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/allenai/scibert" target="_blank">SciBERT</a> (trained on scientific text)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Things to Note:<br>  a</strong>. <strong>Interpret this Model</strong> -  this option allows you to understand your model through several Driverless AI and Surrogate Models. As well, this option provides reason codes for the trained model and its results. For example, when running NLP experiments, Driverless AI offers the following visuals through the <strong>Interpret this Model</strong> option:  <ul>
<li>The following two plots can be located in the <strong>NLP</strong> tab on the <strong>MLI Explanations</strong> page (only visible for NLP models): <img alt="nlp-tab" src="img/466ae97a02931836.jpg">  <ul>
<li><strong>NLP Tokenizer Explainer</strong> - this plot is available for NLP models. It shows both the global and local importance values of each token in a corpus (a large and structured set of texts). The corpus is automatically generated from Driverless AI models&#39; text features prior to the process of tokenization: <img alt="nlp-tokenizer-explainer" src="img/bc13aa2d3b207f07.jpg">  <ul>
<li><strong>NLP LOCO Explainer</strong> - this plot is available for NLP models. It applies a leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) styled approach to NLP models by removing a specific token from all text features in a record and predicting local importance without that token. The difference between the resulting score and the original score (token included) is useful when determining how specific changes to text features alter the model&#39;s predictions: <img alt="nlp-loco-explainer" src="img/241813e4a7c44cac.jpg"></li>
