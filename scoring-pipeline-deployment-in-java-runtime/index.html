        <p><strong>Machine Learning Model Deployment</strong> is the process of making your model available in production environments, so it can be used to make predictions for other software systems. Before model deployment, <strong>feature engineering</strong> occurs in preparing data that will later be used to train a model. Driverless AI <strong>Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)</strong> combines the best feature engineering and one or more <strong>machine learning models</strong> into a scoring pipeline. The <strong>scoring pipeline</strong> is used to score or predict data when given new test data. The <strong>scoring pipeline</strong> comes in two flavors. The first scoring pipeline is a <strong>Model Object, Optimized(MOJO) Scoring Pipeline</strong>, a standalone, low-latency model object designed to be easily embeddable in production environments. The second scoring pipeline is a Python Scoring Pipeline, which has a heavy footprint that is all Python and uses the latest libraries of Driverless AI to allow for executing custom scoring recipes.</p>
<p>For this self-paced course, we will continue making use of the prebuilt experiment: <strong>Model_deployment_HydraulicSystem.</strong>  The Driverless AI  experiment is a classifier model that classifies whether the <strong>cooling condition</strong> of a <strong>Hydraulic System Test Rig</strong> is 3, 20, or 100. By looking at the <strong>cooling condition,</strong> we can predict whether the Hydraulic Cooler operates <strong>close to total failure</strong>, <strong>reduced efficiency</strong>, or <strong>full efficiency</strong>.</p>

<p>The Hydraulic System Test Rig data for this self-paced course comes from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems#" target="_blank"><strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository: Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems Data Set</strong></a>. The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit connected via the oil tank [1]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows, and temperatures. The condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump, and accumulator) is quantitatively varied. The data set contains raw process sensor data (i.e., without feature extraction), structured as matrices (tab-delimited) with the rows representing the cycles and the columns the data points within a cycle. Hydraulic System Test Rigs are used to test Aircraft Equipment components, Automotive Applications, and more [2]. A Hydraulic Test Rig can test a range of flow rates that can achieve different pressures with the ability to heat and cool while simulating testing under different conditions [3]. Testing the pressure, the volume flow, and the temperature is possible by Hydraulic Test Rig sensors and a digital display. The display panel alerts the user when certain testing criteria are met while displaying either a green or red light [3]. Further, a filter blockage panel indicator is integrated into the panel to ensure the Hydraulic Test Rig&#39;s oil is maintained [3]. In the case of predicting cooling conditions for a Hydraulic System, when the cooling condition is low, our prediction will tell us that the cooling of the Hydraulic System is close to total failure, and we may need to look into replacing the cooling filtration solution soon.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="cylinder-diagram-1" src="img/a8b156e42a5fb1f0.png"></p>
<p>By the end of this self-paced course, you will predict the <strong>cooling condition</strong> for a <strong>Hydraulic System Test Rig</strong> by deploying an <strong>embeddable MOJO Scoring Pipeline</strong> into <strong>Java Runtime</strong> using <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Sparkling Water</strong>, and <strong>PySparkling</strong>.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>MOJO Scoring Pipeline Files</h2>
<p>After downloading the MOJO scoring pipeline, the <strong>mojo-pipeline</strong> folder comes with many files. The files needed to execute the MOJO scoring pipeline are as follows: <strong>pipeline.mojo</strong>, <strong>mojo2-runtime.jar</strong>, and <strong>example.csv</strong>. As well, in the <strong>mojo-pipeline</strong> folder, we can find the following file that helps run the pipeline relatively quickly: <strong>run_example.sh</strong>. Further, the <strong>mojo-pipeline</strong> folder contains the <strong>pipeline.mojo</strong> file, which is the standalone scoring pipeline in MOJO format. This pipeline file contains the packaged feature engineering pipeline and the machine learning model. Further, the folder also includes a jar name <strong>mojo2-runtime.jar</strong>, the MOJO Java API. And to test our code, the file has a CSV name <strong>example.csv</strong> containing sample test data.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Embedding the MOJO into the Java Runtime</h2>
<p>If you have gone through the earlier scoring pipeline deployment self-paced courses, you have seen how we deploy the MOJO Scoring Pipeline to a server or serverless instance. Some clients interact with the server to trigger it to execute the MOJO to make predictions. An alternative way to deploy the MOJO Scoring Pipeline is to embed it directly into the Java Runtime Environment where your application is running. So if you are building a Java application using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor, you can import the MOJO Java API. Then use it to load the MOJO, put your test data into a MOJO frame, perform predictions on the data, and return the results.</p>

</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Task 3: Batch Scoring" duration="0">
        <p>You will execute the MOJO scoring pipeline in the Java Runtime Environment using Java, PySparkling, and Sparkling Water.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Batch Scoring Through the Run Executemojo Java Example</h2>
<p>You will run the <strong>run_example.sh</strong> script that came with the mojo-pipeline folder. This script requires the mojo file, CSV file, and license file. It runs the Java <strong>ExecuteMojo</strong> example program, and the mojo makes predictions for a batch of Hydraulic cooling conditions.</p>
<p>Since we already have our license file path specified as an environment variable, we will pass in the path to the following three files: run_example.sh, pipeline.mojo, and example.csv. Right after, we will run them to get our predictions.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd $HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/
bash run_example.sh pipeline.mojo example.csv
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="batch-scoring-via-shell-script.png" src="img/3338522c9003c043.png"></p>
<p>This classification output is the batch scoring done for our Hydraulic System cooling condition. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, and cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency, and 100 means operating at full efficiency.</p>
<p>The results will give you a probability (a decimal value) for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, and cool_cond_y.100. After converting each decimal value to a percentage, note that the highest percentage per row will determine the type of cool_cond_y for that row.</p>
<p>Similarly, we could execute <strong>run_example.sh</strong> without passing arguments to it by creating temporary environment variables for the mojo pipeline file and an example CSV file path.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">export MOJO_PIPELINE_FILE=&#34;$HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo&#34;
export EXAMPLE_CSV_FILE=&#34;$HOME/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/example.csv&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>Now execute the <strong>run_example.sh</strong>, and you should get similar results as above.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">bash run_example.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, we can also execute the <strong>ExecuteMojo</strong> Java application directly as below and get similar results as above:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">java -Dai.h2o.mojos.runtime.license.key=$DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY -cp mojo2-runtime.jar ai.h2o.mojos.ExecuteMojo $MOJO_PIPELINE_FILE $EXAMPLE_CSV_FILE
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="executemojo.png" src="img/799d3bbf5659764c.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Batch Scoring Through the Run PySparkling Program</h2>
<p>Start <strong>PySparkling</strong> to enter the <strong>PySpark</strong> interactive terminal:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd $HOME/sparkling-water-3.30.0.6-1-3.0
# Note: You might get the following error when executing the below command: 
# &#34;colorama&#34; package is not installed, please install it as: pip install colorama
# &#34;requests&#34; package is not installed, please install it as: pip install requests
# &#34;tabulate&#34; package is not installed, please install it as: pip install tabulate
# &#34;future&#34; package is not installed, please install it as: pip install future
# If you get the above error, you need to install the above packages. Right after, try the below command again. 
./bin/pysparkling --jars $DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="batch-scoring-via-pysparkling-program-1" src="img/363d0dd85444c95c.png"></p>
<p>Now that we are in the PySpark interactive terminal, we will import some dependencies:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java"># First, specify the dependency
import os.path
from pysparkling.ml import H2OMOJOPipelineModel,H2OMOJOSettings
</code></pre>
<p>We configured the H2O MOJO Settings to ensure the output columns are appropriately named. Now we will load the MOJO scoring pipeline:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java"># The &#39;namedMojoOutputColumns&#39; option ensures the output columns are named properly.
settings = H2OMOJOSettings(namedMojoOutputColumns = True)
homePath = os.path.expanduser(&#34;~&#34;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java"># Load the pipeline. &#39;settings&#39; is an optional argument.
mojo = H2OMOJOPipelineModel.createFromMojo(homePath + &#34;/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo&#34;, settings)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, load the example CSV data as a Spark&#39;s DataFrame</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java"># Load the data as Spark&#39;s Data Frame
dataFrame = spark.read.csv(homePath + &#34;/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/example.csv&#34;, header=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we will run batch scoring on the Spark DataFrame using mojo transform. Right after, we will  get the scored data for the cool hydraulic condition:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java"># Run the predictions. The predictions contain all the original columns plus the predictions added as new columns
predictions = mojo.transform(dataFrame)

# Get the predictions for desired cols using array with selected col names
predictions.select([mojo.selectPredictionUDF(&#34;cool_cond_y.3&#34;), mojo.selectPredictionUDF(&#34;cool_cond_y.20&#34;), mojo.selectPredictionUDF(&#34;cool_cond_y.100&#34;)]).collect()
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="batch-scoring-via-pysparkling-program-2" src="img/694b1165db1a5db4.png"></p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Quit PySparkling
quit()
</code></pre>
<p>The MOJO predicted the Hydraulic System cooling condition for each row within the batch of Hydraulic System test data we provided. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, and cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency, and 100 means operating at full efficiency.</p>
<p>Accordingly, that is how you execute the MOJO scoring pipeline to do batch scoring using PySparkling.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Batch Scoring Through the Run Sparkling Water Program</h2>
<p>Start <strong>Sparkling Water</strong> to enter Spark&#39;s interactive terminal:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd $HOME/sparkling-water-3.30.0.6-1-3.0
./bin/sparkling-shell --jars $DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY

<p class="image-container"><img alt="batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-1" src="img/8bc3bdae3c953995.png"></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-2" src="img/4053c8cf07a99b5f.png"></p>
<p>Now that we are in the Spark interactive terminal, we will import some dependencies:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java">// First, specify the dependency
import ai.h2o.sparkling.ml.models.{H2OMOJOPipelineModel,H2OMOJOSettings}
</code></pre>
<p>Now configure the <strong>H2O MOJO Settings</strong> to ensure the output columns are correctly named. As well, load the MOJO scoring pipeline:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java">// The &#39;namedMojoOutputColumns&#39; option ensures the output columns are named properly.
val settings = H2OMOJOSettings(namedMojoOutputColumns = true)

val homePath = sys.env(&#34;HOME&#34;)

<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java">// Load the pipeline. &#39;settings&#39; is an optional argument.
val mojo = H2OMOJOPipelineModel.createFromMojo(homePath + &#34;/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/pipeline.mojo&#34;, settings)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, load the example CSV data as a Spark&#39;s DataFrame.</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java">// Load the data as a Spark&#39;s DataFrame
val dataFrame = spark.read.option(&#34;header&#34;, &#34;true&#34;).csv(homePath + &#34;/dai-mojo-java/mojo-pipeline/example.csv&#34;)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we will run batch scoring on the Spark DataFrame using mojo transform; with it, we will get the scored data for cool efficiency:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java">// Run the predictions. The predictions contain all the original columns plus the predictions.
val predictions = mojo.transform(dataFrame)

# Get the predictions for desired cols sep by comma with selected col names
predictions.select(mojo.selectPredictionUDF(&#34;cool_cond_y.3&#34;), mojo.selectPredictionUDF(&#34;cool_cond_y.20&#34;), mojo.selectPredictionUDF(&#34;cool_cond_y.100&#34;)).show()
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="batch-scoring-via-sparkling-water-3" src="img/f0a6c3fb7b016ba8.png"></p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Quit Sparkling Water
:quit
</code></pre>
<p>The MOJO predicted the Hydraulic System cooling condition for each row within the batch of Hydraulic System test data we provided. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, and cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency, and 100 means operating at full efficiency.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, that is how you execute the MOJO scoring pipeline to do batch scoring using Sparkling Water.</p>

<p>Paste the above Java code to your <strong>ExecuteDaiMojo.java</strong>. Move the java file to the <strong>MojoDeployment</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Now we have our Java code, let&#39;s compile it:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">javac -cp mojo2-runtime.jar -J-Xms2g ExecuteDaiMojo.java
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the <strong>ExecuteDaiMojo.class</strong> has been generated, run this Java program to execute the MOJO:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">java -Dai.h2o.mojos.runtime.license.file=$DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY -cp .:mojo2-runtime.jar ExecuteDaiMojo
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Windows users run</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">java -Dai.h2o.mojos.runtime.license.file=license.sig -cp .;mojo2-runtime.jar ExecuteDaiMojo
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="interactive-scoring-via-custom-java-program-1" src="img/ee67f8424af9eb64.png"></p>
<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>cool_cond_y.3 =  0.28380922973155975</li>
<li>cool_cond_y.20 = 0.14792289088169733</li>
<li>cool_cond_y.100 = 0.5682678818702698</li>
</ul>
<p>The MOJO predicted the cooling condition for the individual row of Hydraulic System <em>test data</em> we passed to it. You should receive classification probabilities for cool_cond_y.3, cool_cond_y.20, and cool_cond_y.100. The 3 means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, 20 means it is operating at reduced efficiency, and 100 means operating at full efficiency.</p>
<p>So that is how you execute the MOJO scoring pipeline to do interactive scoring using Java directly.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Execute Scoring Pipeline for a New Dataset</h2>
<p>You could do something that helps you in your daily life or job. Maybe you could reproduce the steps we did above, but for a new experiment or dataset. In that case, you could either decide to do batch scoring, interactive scoring, or both.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Embed Scoring Pipeline into Existing Program</h2>
<p>Another challenge could be to use the existing MOJO scoring pipeline we executed. Instead of using the examples, we shared above, integrate the scoring pipeline into an existing Java, Python, or Scala program.</p>
