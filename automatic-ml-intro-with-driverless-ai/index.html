        <h2 is-upgraded>Overview</h2>
<p>H2O Driverless AI is an artificial intelligence(AI) platform for automatic machine learning. Driverless AI automates some of the most difficult data science and machine learning workflows such as feature engineering, model validation, model tuning, model selection, and model deployment. It aims to achieve highest predictive accuracy, comparable to expert data scientists, but in much shorter time thanks to end-to-end automation. Driverless AI also offers automatic visualizations and machine learning interpretability(MLI). Especially in regulated industries, model transparency and explanation are just as important as predictive performance. Modeling pipelines (feature engineering and models) are exported (in full fidelity, without approximations) both as Python modules and as pure Java standalone scoring artifacts.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Why Driverless AI?</h2>
<p>Over the last several years, machine learning has become an integral part of many organizations&#39; decision-making process at various levels. With not enough data scientists to fill the increasing demand for data-driven business processes, H2O.ai offers Driverless AI, which automates several time consuming aspects of a typical data science workflow, including data visualization, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and model explanation.</p>
<p>H2O Driverless AI is a high-performance, GPU-enabled computing platform for automatic development and rapid deployment of state-of-the-art predictive analytics models. It reads tabular data from plain text sources, Hadoop, or S3 buckets and automates data visualization and building predictive models. Driverless AI targets business applications such as loss-given-default, probability of default, customer churn, campaign response, fraud detection, anti-money-laundering, demand forecasting, and predictive asset maintenance models. (Or in machine learning parlance: common regression, binomial classification, and multinomial classification problems).</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: Automatic Machine Learning Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
<p>The concepts found in this task are meant to provide a high-level overview of Machine Learning. At the end of this task, you can find links to resources that offer a more in-depth explanation of the concepts covered here.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence where the focus is to create machines that can simulate human intelligence. One critical distinction between artificial intelligence and machine learning is that machine learning models &#34;learn&#34; from the data the models get exposed to. Arthur Samuel, a machine learning pioneer back in 1959, defined machine learning as a &#34; field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed&#34; [1]. A machine learning algorithm trains on a dataset to make predictions. These predictions are, at times, used to optimize a system or assist with decision-making.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Machine Learning Training</h2>
<p>Advances in technology have made it easier for data to be collected and made available. The available type of data will determine the kind of training that the machine learning model can undergo. There are two types of machine learning training, supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is when the dataset contains the output that you are trying to predict. For those cases where the predicting variable is not present, it&#39;s called unsupervised learning. Both types of training define the relationship between input and output variables.</p>
<p>In machine learning, the input variables are called <strong>features</strong> and the output variables <strong>labels</strong>. The labels, in this case, are what we are trying to predict. The goal is to take the inputs/variables/features and use them to come up with predictions on never-before-seen data. In linear regression, the features are the x-variables, and the labels are the y-variables. An example of a label could be the future price of avocados. In terms of feature examples regarding this self-paced course, in Task 3, we will see the following features when creating our survival prediction model: passenger class, sex, age, passenger fare, cabin number, etc.</p>
<p>A machine learning model defines the relationship between features and labels. Anyone can train a model by feeding it examples of particular instances of data. You can have two types of examples: labeled and unlabeled. Labeled examples are those where the X and Y values (features, labels) are known. Unlabeled examples are those where we know the X value, but we don&#39;t know the Y value[1]. Your dataset is similar to an example; the columns that will be used for training are the features; the rows are the instances of those features. The column that you want to predict is the label.</p>
<p>Supervised learning takes labeled examples and allows a model that is being trained to learn the relationship between features and labels. The trained model can then be used on unlabelled data to predict the missing Y value. The model can be tested with either labeled or unlabeled data. Note that H2O Driverless AI creates models with labeled examples.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Data Preparation</h2>
<p>A machine learning model is as good as the data that is used to train it. If you use garbage data to train your model, you will get a garbage model. With that said, before uploading a dataset into tools that will assist you with building your machine learning model, such as Driverless AI, ensure that the dataset has been cleaned and prepared for training. Transforming raw data into another format, which is more appropriate and valuable for analytics, is called data wrangling.</p>
<p>Data wrangling can include extractions, parsing, joining, standardizing, augmenting, cleansing, and consolidating until the missing data is fixed or removed. Data preparation includes the dataset being in the correct format for what you are trying to do; accordingly, duplicates are removed, missing data is fixed or removed, and finally, categorical values are transformed or encoded to a numerical type. Tools like <a href="https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest" target="_blank">Python datatable</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> are great assets for data wrangling.</p>
<p>Data wrangling can be done in Driverless AI via a <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">data recipe</a>, the <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/connectors-nd/jdbc.html?highlight=jdbc" target="_blank">JDBC connector</a> or through <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/datasets-describing.html?highlight=live%20code#modify-by-recipe" target="_blank">live code</a> which will create a new dataset by modifying the existing one.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Data Transformation/Feature Engineering</h2>
<p>Data transformation or feature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing ones. Proper data transformations on a dataset can include scaling, decomposition, and aggregation [2]. Some data transformations include looking at all the features and identifying which features can be combined to make new ones that will be more useful to the model&#39;s performance. For categorical features, the recommendation is for classes that have few observations to be grouped to reduce the likelihood of the model overfitting. Categorical features may be converted to numerical representations since many algorithms cannot handle categorical features directly. Besides, data transformation removes features that are not used or are redundant[3]. These are only a few suggestions when approaching feature engineering. Feature engineering is very time-consuming due to its repetitive nature; it can also be costly. After successfully or having a notion of well-done data transformation, the next step in creating a model is selecting an algorithm.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Algorithm Selection</h2>
<p>&#34;Machine learning algorithms are described as learning a target function (f) that best maps input variables (x) to an output variable(y): Y= f(x)&#34; [4]. In supervised learning, there are many algorithms to select from for training. The type of algorithm(s) will depend on the size of your data set, structure, and the type of problem you are trying to solve.  Through trial and error, the best performing algorithms can be found for your dataset. Some of those algorithms include linear regression, regression trees, random forests, Naive Bayes, and boosting, to name a few [5].</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Model Training</h2>
<p><strong>Datasets</strong></p>
<p>When training a machine learning model, one good practice is to split up your dataset into subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. A good ratio for the entire dataset is 70-15-15, 70% of the whole dataset for training, 15% for validation, and the remaining 15% for testing. The <strong>training set</strong> is the data used to train the model, and it needs to be big enough to get significant results from it. The <strong>validation set</strong> is the data held back from the training and will be used to evaluate and adjust the trained model&#39;s hyperparameters and, hence, adjust the performance. Finally, the <strong>test set</strong> is data that has also been held back and will be used to confirm the final model&#39;s results [1].</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The validation dataset is used for tuning the modeling pipeline. If provided, the entire training data will be used for training, and validation of the modeling pipeline is performed with only this validation dataset. When you do not include a validation dataset, Driverless AI will do K-fold cross-validation for I.I.D. (identically and independently distributed)  experiments and multiple rolling window validation splits for time series experiments. For this reason, it is not generally recommended to include a validation dataset as you are then validating on only a single dataset. Please note that time series experiments cannot be used with a validation dataset: including a validation dataset will disable the ability to select a time column and vice versa.</p>
<p>This dataset must have the same number of columns (and column types) as the training dataset. Also, note that if provided, the validation set is not sampled down, so it can lead to large memory usage, even if accuracy=1 (which reduces the train size). In a moment, we will learn more about <strong>accuracy</strong> when preparing an experiment.[10]</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/3a59964e9ce8782e.jpg">     </p>
<p>Another part of model training is fitting and tuning the models. For fitting and tuning, hyperparameters need to be tuned, and cross-validation needs to take place using only the training data. Various hyperparameter values will need to be tested. &#34;A hyperparameter is a parameter that is set before the learning process begins. These parameters are tunable and can directly affect how well a model trains. [In Machine Learning, a hyperparameter is the learning rate]&#34; [7]. In other words, the hyperparameter value is used to determine the rate at which the model learns.</p>
<p>With cross-validation, the whole dataset is utilized, and each model is trained on a different subset of the training data [8]. Additionally, a cross-validation loop will be set to calculate the cross-validation score for each set of hyperparameters for each algorithm. Based on the cross-validation score and hyperparameter values, you can select the model for each algorithm that has been tuned with training data and tested with your test set. Remember that &#34;a model in [Machine Learning(ML)] is the output of an ML algorithm run on data. It represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm.&#34; [9]</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What are the challenges in AI Model Development?</h2>
<p>One of the significant challenges in developing a single production-ready model is that it can take weeks or months to build it. Developing a model involves feature engineering, model building, and model deployment. All tasks are very repetitive, time-consuming, require advanced knowledge of feature generation, algorithms, parameters, and model deployment. Finally, there needs to be in-depth knowledge and confidence in how the model was generated to justify how it made its decisions.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is Automated Machine Learning, and why is it important?</h2>
<p>AutoML or Automated Machine Learning is the process of automating algorithm selection, feature generation, hyperparameter tuning, iterative modeling, and model assessment. AutoML tools such as H2O Driverless AI makes it easy to train and evaluate machine learning models. Automating the repetitive tasks around Machine Learning development allows individuals to focus on the data and the business problems they are trying to solve.</p>
<p>With this task in mind, let&#39;s explore and load the data that we will be using when predicting whether a passenger would&#39;ve survived the titanic accident.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>About the Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this experiment is a version of the Titanic Kaggle dataset. This dataset contains the list of estimated passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.</p>
<p>The RMS Titanic was a British commercial passenger liner that sank after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912. More than 1,500 people lost their lives from an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew members while on their way to New York City from Southampton.</p>
<p>This tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. The lack of lifeboats, amongst other things, was one of the factors that resulted in a significant loss of life. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</p>

<p>4. Exit and return to the <strong>Datasets</strong> page.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Split the Dataset</h2>
<p>From the <em>Titanic.csv</em> dataset, we are going to create two datasets, <em>training</em> and <em>test</em>. 75% of the data will be used to train the model, and the other 25% will be used to test the trained model.</p>
<p>1. Click on the <em>titanic.csv</em> file and select <strong>Split</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="titanic-set-split-1" src="img/2789a38948b3eda9.png"></p>
<p>2. Split the data into two sets: <code>titanic_train</code> and <code>titanic_test</code>, then save the changes. Use the image below as a guide:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="titanic-set-split-2" src="img/e1f09ff57fc32829.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note:<br></em>  <strong>a.</strong> For <strong>OUTPUT NAME 1</strong>: enter <code>titanic_train</code> (this will serve as the training set)<br><strong>b.</strong> For <strong>OUTPUT NAME 2</strong>: enter <code>titanic_test</code> (this will serve as the test set)<br><strong>c.</strong> You can change the Random Seed; this will generate the same split every time<br><strong>d.</strong> Change the split value to .75 by adjusting the slider to 75% or entering .75 in the section that says <em>SELECT SPLIT RATIO(BY ROWS)<br></em><strong>e.</strong> Save the changes you made</li>
</ul>
<p>The split ratio of .75 (75% for the training set and 25% for the test set) was selected for this particular dataset, not to generalize the model given the set&#39;s total size.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The training set</strong> contains 981 rows, each row representing a passenger and 16 columns representing each passenger&#39;s attributes.</li>
<li><strong>The Test set</strong> contains 328 rows, each row representing a passenger and 16 attribute columns representing attributes of each passenger.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Verify that the three Titanic datasets, <em>titanic_test</em>, <em>titanic_train</em>, and <em>titanic.csv</em>, are there:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="three-datasets" src="img/a10142e9475b21fb.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Autoviz</h2>
<p>Now that the <em>titanic.csv</em> dataset has been split, we will now use the <strong>titanic_train</strong> dataset. Before we begin our experiment, let&#39;s begin by visualizing our dataset while further understanding what features and labels will play a crucial role in our Machine learning model.</p>
<p>There are two ways to visualize the training set:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="titanic-train-visualize" src="img/484f97988c230662.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note:<br></em><strong>a. Method One</strong>: Clicking on the <strong>titanic_train</strong> file, select <strong>Visualize</strong>, then click on the visualization file generated.<br><strong>b. Method Two</strong>: Clicking on the <strong>Autoviz</strong> section(button) inside the section, you will need to click on the <strong>+ NEW VISUALIZATION</strong> button. It will ask you to pick the dataset you want to visualize.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Pick a method to visualize the <strong>titanic_train</strong> dataset. Right after, the following will appear:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="train-set-visualization-ready" src="img/5309a6f89a869892.png"></p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>titanic_train</strong> visualization, and the following graphs will appear:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="train-set-visualizations" src="img/4b015ff400b4d.png"></p>
<p>Is it possible to visualize how variables on the training set are correlated? Can we determine what other variables are strongly correlated to a passenger&#39;s survival? The answer to those questions is <strong>yes!</strong> One of the graphs that allow us to visualize the correlations between variables is the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Let&#39;s explore the correlation between the <strong>survived</strong> variable and other variables in the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong> and then click on <strong>Help</strong> located at the graph&#39;s lower-left corner.</li>
<li>Take a minute to read about how Driverless AI constructed the correlation graph. Learn more about how variables are color-coded to show their correlations.</li>
<li>Take the ‘survived&#39; variable and drag it slightly to look at the other variables correlated to the <strong>survived</strong> attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>What variables are strongly correlated with the ‘survived&#39; variable? Based on the correlation graph, we can see that no correlations were inferred to the <strong>survived</strong> attribute based on the <em>titanic_train</em> dataset. Although the graph inferred no correlation, that is not to say that we will not be able to predict whether someone will survive the titanic accident. Visualizing the dataset only gives us an idea/preview of what data will be used to train our model. As well, visualizing can allow for a deeper understanding while highlighting outliers.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="train-set-correlation-graph" src="img/3abf8df1d68bf5e6.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note:<br></em><strong>a. Download</strong> allows for a full-scale image of the Graph to be downloaded.<br><strong>b.</strong> The <strong>Help</strong> button explains the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong>. This feature is available for all graphs.</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Exit out of the <strong>Correlation Graph</strong> view by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> at the graph&#39;s top-right corner.</p>
<p>5. After you are done exploring the other graphs, go back to the <strong>Datasets page</strong>. While exploring, keep in mind that Driverless AI shows graphs that represent &#34;relevant&#34; aspects of the data. The following are the type of graphs available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correlated Scatterplots</li>
<li>Spikey Histograms</li>
<li>Skewed Histograms</li>
<li>Varying Boxplots</li>
<li>Heteroscedastic Boxplots</li>
<li>Biplots</li>
<li>Outliers</li>
<li>Correlation Graph</li>
<li>Parallel Coordinates Plot</li>
<li>Radar Plot</li>
<li>Data Heatmap</li>
<li>Missing Values Heatmap</li>
<li>Gaps Histogram</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next task, we will proceed to step 3 of our Driverless AI workflow: run an experiment.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 5: Launch First Experiment" duration="0">
        <p>We are going to launch our first experiment. An experiment means that we are going to generate a prediction using a dataset of our choice. In this case, we will use the <strong>titanic_train</strong> dataset.</p>
<p>1. Return to the <strong>Datasets Overview</strong> page and click on the <strong>titanic_train</strong> dataset, then select <strong>Predict</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="titanic-train-predict" src="img/7953d5380bdc808e.png"></p>
<p>If this is your first time launching an experiment, the following prompt will appear, asking if you want to take a tour:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="driverless-tour" src="img/d3ce4845787461cf.jpg"></p>
<p>If you would like to take a quick tour of the <strong>Experiments</strong> page, select <strong>YES</strong>; the short tour will cover the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a training dataset</li>
<li>Selecting a target column that you want Driverless AI to predict</li>
<li>Selecting if it is a Time Series problem or not [Time Series ON or OFF]</li>
</ul>
<p>2. For the time being, select <strong>Not Now</strong> you can go back later and take a tour. For the most part, this self-paced course will cover what&#39;s mentioned during the tour.</p>
<p>3. The <strong>Experiment preview page</strong> will appear; this preview page displays all settings that Driverless AI  will use before launching an experiment:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="train-set-experiment-page" src="img/160fece2dcbe2a0f.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note:<br></em><strong>a. Assistant</strong> - Interactive tour for first-time users.  <ul>
<li>Click on <strong>ASSISTANT</strong> to enable it. Yellow circles will appear around sections of the experiment setup page; you can hover over any of them to get more information on each section: <img alt="titanic-train-assist-sample" src="img/f593aedf299a30ed.png"><strong>Note:</strong> To disable <strong>ASSISTANT</strong>, click on assistant again.<br></li>
</ul>
  <strong>b. Display Name</strong> - Optional: Specify a display name for the new experiment. There are no character or length restrictions for naming. If this field is left blank, Driverless AI will automatically generate a name for the experiment.<br><strong>c. Training Dataset</strong> - The name of the Dataset being used to create an experiment<br><strong>d. Rows</strong> - Total number of rows<br><strong>e. Columns</strong> - Total number of columns<br><strong>f. Dropped Columns</strong> - Drop column(s) from your Dataset that you don&#39;t want to use in the experiment. For more information, see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#dropped-columns" target="_blank">here</a><br><strong>g. Validation Dataset</strong> - Select the Dataset you want to validate. This set will be used to validate parameters like models, features, etc. For more information, see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#validation-dataset" target="_blank">here</a><br><strong>h. Test Dataset</strong> - The Dataset will test the model generated from the training dataset. It&#39;s not used during the model&#39;s training, and results are available at the end of the experiment. For more information, see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#test-dataset" target="_blank">here</a><br><strong>i. Target Column</strong> - The column that will be used to predict furthermore is the piece of data you want to understand. When selecting a target column, ask yourself what you want to predict<br><strong>j. Fold Column</strong> - The fold column is used to create the training and validation datasets so that all rows with the same fold value will be in the same Dataset. This column will be used if no validation dataset is provided and the model is trained using cross-validation. For more information, see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#fold-column" target="_blank">here</a><br><strong>k. Weight Column</strong> - Column that indicates the observation/instance weight (a.k.a. sample or row weight), if applicable. For more information see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#weight-column" target="_blank">here</a><br><strong>l. Time Column</strong>(OFF by default) - Provides a time order(timestamps for observations). When data has a high dependency on time (such as seasonality or trend), you want to treat this problem as a time series problem. For more information, see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#time-column" target="_blank">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>4. Continuing with our experiment, name your experiment as follows: <code>Titanic Classification Tutorial</code></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Dropped Columns</strong>, drop the following columns, then select <strong>Done</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passenger_Id</strong></li>
<li><strong>name_with_salutations</strong></li>
<li><strong>name_without_salutations</strong></li>
<li><strong>boat</strong></li>
<li><strong>body</strong></li>
<li><strong>home.dest</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="train-set-drop-columns" src="img/b52e63647cee417d.png"></p>
<p>We removed these attributes (columns) to create a cleaner dataset. Attributes such as <strong>boa</strong>t and <strong>body</strong> are excluded because they are clear indicators that a passenger survived and can lead to data leakage. A clean dataset is essential for the creation of a good predictive model. The process of data cleansing needs to be done with all datasets to rid the set of any unwanted observations, structural errors, unwanted outliers, or missing data.</p>
<p>6. For our experiment, we will be using a test dataset. To select the test dataset, select <strong>TEST DATASET</strong> and select the <strong>titanic_test</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="add-test-set" src="img/1f2d6dda659d87f5.png"></p>
<p>7. Now, select the <strong>TARGET COLUMN</strong>. In our case, the column will be <strong>survived</strong>. We want to know who will be <em>surviving</em> base on the information the model will be trained on (e.g., age):</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="train-set-drop-name-column" src="img/162f2ab8a929f593.png"></p>
<p>The <em>survived</em> attribute was selected because, as an insurance company, we want to know what attributes can contribute to passengers&#39; survival. Knowing these attributes from the perspective of an insurance company can be beneficial because it can give the insurance company a good idea of how to manage the rate of insurances.</p>
<p>8. Your experiment page should look similar to the one below; these are the system suggestions based on the data selected to train this model:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="experiment-settings" src="img/483643eb0f8970b8.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note:<br></em><strong>a. Training Settings</strong> - Describes your specific experiment&#39;s Accuracy, Time, and Interpretability. The knobs on the experiment settings are adjustable as values change the settings&#39; meaning on the left-bottom page change.<br>  <ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong> - As accuracy increases, Driverless AI gradually adjusts the method for performing the evolution and ensemble. At low accuracy, Driverless AI varies features and models, but they all compete evenly against each other. At higher accuracy, each independent main model will evolve independently and be part of the final ensemble as an ensemble over different main models. At higher accuracies, Driverless AI will evolve+ensemble feature types like Target Encoding on and off that evolve independently. Finally, at highest accuracies, Driverless AI performs both model and feature tracking and ensembles all those variations. Changing this value affects the feature evolution and final pipeline.<br><strong>Note:</strong> A check for a shift in the distribution between train and test is done for accuracy &gt;= 5.  <ul>
<li><strong>Feature evolution:</strong> This represents the algorithms used to create the experiment. If a test set is provided without a validation set, then Driverless AI will perform a 1⁄3 validation split during the experiment. If a validation set is provided, then the experiment will perform external validation.</li>
<li><strong>Final pipeline:</strong> This represents the number of models and the validation method used in the final pipeline. For ensemble modeling, information about how models are combined is also shown here.</li>
<li>For more information about <strong>Accuracy</strong> see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy%20setting#accuracy" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> - This specifies the relative Time for completing the experiment (i.e., higher settings take longer). Early stopping will occur if the experiment doesn&#39;t improve the score for the specified amount of iterations.  <ul>
<li>For more information about <strong>Time</strong> see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#time" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interpretability</strong> -  Specify the relative Interpretability for this experiment. Higher values favor more interpretable models. Changing the interpretability level affects the feature pre-pruning strategy, monotonicity constraints, and the feature engineering search space.<br>   <ul>
<li>For more information about <strong>Interpretability</strong> see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#interpretability" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></li>

</ul>
  <strong>d. Classification/Regression</strong> - Classification or Regression button; Driverless AI automatically determines the problem type based on the target column. Though not recommended, you can override this setting by clicking this button.  <ul>
<li>For more information about <strong>Classification/Regression</strong> see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#classification-regression-button" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></li>
</ul>
  <strong>e. GPUs Enabled</strong> - Specify whether to enable GPUs. (Note that this option is ignored on CPU-only systems).  <ul>
<li>For more information about <strong>GPUs Enabled</strong> see the H2O.ai documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/experiment-settings.html?highlight=accuracy#enable-gpus" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></li>

<li><strong>Scores</strong> or model scores allow you to view the detailed information about model scores after an experiment is complete.</li>
<li>While the experiment is running, you can access the logs by clicking on the <strong>Log</strong> button on the experiment screen. The <strong>Log</strong> button can be found in the CPU/Memory section.</li>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong> inform you of different aspects of the experiment running(e.g., Shift in variable importance detected). Clicking on the Log button will present the experiment logs in real-time. You can download these logs by clicking on the Download Logs button in the upper right corner.<br></li>
</ul>
  <strong>f. Iteration Data</strong> and <strong>Variable Importance</strong>:  <ul>
<li>The iteration data (internal validation) for each cross validation fold along with the specified scorer value. Click on a specific iteration or drag to view a range of iterations. Double click in the graph to reset the view. In this graph, each &#34;column&#34; represents one iteration of the experiment. During the iteration, Driverless AI will train 𝑛 models. (This is called individuals in the experiment preview). So for any column, you may see the score value for those 𝑛 models for each iteration on the graph.</li>
<li>Driverless AI performs automatic feature engineering as part of an experiment&#39;s model building process. New features are created by doing transformations and/or interactions on the dataset columns. Feature creation and selection is evolutionary (based on variable importance of previous iteration) in nature and uses genetic algorithms to find the best set of feature transformations and model parameters for an experiment/dataset.</li>
<li>The variable importance values. To view variable importance for a specific iteration, just select that iteration in the Iteration Data graph. The Variable Importance list will automatically update to show variable importance information for that iteration. Hover over an entry to view more info.</li>
</ul>
  <strong>g.</strong> This section provides different graphs depending on the machine learning algorithm being used. The dashboard graphs are displayed for running and completed experiments. These graphs are interactive. Hover over a point on the graph for more details about the point. For example:  <ul>
<li>For <strong>Binary Classification experiments</strong>, Driverless AI shows a ROC Curve, a Precision-Recall graph, a Lift chart, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov chart, and a Gains chart.</li>
<li>For <strong>multiclass classification experiments</strong>, a Confusion Matrix is available in addition to the ROC Curve, Precision-Recall graph, Lift chart, Kolmogorov-Smirnov chart, and Gains chart. Driverless AI generates these graphs by considering the multiclass problem as multiple one-vs-all problems. These graphs and charts (Confusion Matrix excepted) are based on a method known as micro-averaging.</li>
<li>For <strong>Regression Experiments</strong>, Driverless AI shows a Residuals graphs and an Actual vs. Predicted graph.</li>

        <p>Again, Driverless AI performs feature engineering on the dataset to determine the optimal representation of the data being used to train the models  (experiment):</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="feature-engineering-1" src="img/b3b24cc748e05b55.jpg"></p>
<p>Transformations in Driverless AI are applied to columns in the data. The transformers create the engineered features in experiments. Driverless AI provides a number of transformers. The following transformers are available for regression and classification (multiclass and binary) experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numeric Transformers</li>
<li>Categorical Transformers</li>
<li>Time and Date Transformers</li>
<li>Time Series Transformers</li>
<li>NLP (text) Transformers</li>
<li>Image Transformers</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are just some of the transformers found in our experiment:</p>
<p>1. Look at some of the variables in the following section: <strong>Variable Importance</strong>. Note that some of the variables start with <code>_CVTE</code>(_CVTargetEncode) followed by the dataset&#39;s column name. Other variables might also begin with <code>_NumToCatTE</code> or <code>_WoE</code> depending on the experiment you run. These are the new, high-value features for our training dataset.</p>
<p>These transformations are created with the following transformers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross Validation Target Encoding Transformer: <code>_CVTE</code>  <ul>
<li>The Cross Validation Target Encoding Transformer calculates the mean of the response column for each value in a categorical column and uses this as a new feature. Cross Validation is used to calculate mean response to prevent overfitting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weight of Evidence : <code>_WoE</code>  <ul>
<li>The Weight of Evidence Transformer calculates Weight of Evidence for each value in categorical column(s). The Weight of Evidence is used as a new feature. Weight of Evidence measures the &#34;strength&#34; of a grouping for separating good and bad risk and is calculated by taking the log of the ratio of distributions for a binary response column. This only works with a binary target variable. The likelihood needs to be created within a stratified kfold if a fit_transform method is used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numeric to Categorical Target Encoding Transformer: <code>_NumToCatTE</code>  <ul>
<li>The Numeric to Categorical Target Encoding Transformer converts numeric columns to categoricals by binning and then calculates the mean of the response column for each group. The mean of the response for the bin is used as a new feature. Cross Validation is used to calculate mean response to prevent overfitting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about <strong>Driverless AI Transformations</strong> please refer to the Driverless AI documentation <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/userguide/transformations.html?highlight=transformers#driverless-ai-transformations" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>2. Hover over any of the variables under <strong>Variable Importance</strong> to get a simple explanation of the transformer used, as seen in the image below:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 353.00px" src="img/3728aa761127934b.jpg">     </p>
<p>The complete list of features used in the final model is available in the <strong>Experiment Summary and Logs</strong>. The experiment summary also provides a list of the original features and their estimated feature importance. In other words, the experiment summary and logs include the transformations that Driverless AI applied to our titanic experiment.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 7: Explore Experiment Results" duration="0">
        <p>Let&#39;s explore the results of this classification experiment. You can find useful metrics in the experiment <strong>Summary</strong> at the right-bottom of the <strong>Experiment Summary</strong> page.

Now, let us observe and learn about these graphs and the summary generated by Driverless AI. Feel free to follow along as we explore each subsection of the summary section(you can access each discussed graph below by clicking on the name of each graph):</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 555.00px" src="img/377cd48e8bf4c954.png">     </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note<br></em>  <strong>a. Summary<br></strong> Once the experiment is complete, a <strong>Summary</strong> is generated at the bottom-right corner of the experiment page. The summary includes:<br>  <ul>

Some questions to consider when exploring this section:  <ul>
<li>What are the number of features that Driverless AI scored for your model and the total features that Driverless AI selected?</li>
<li>Take a look at the validation Score for the final pipeline and compare that value to the test score. Based on those scores, would you consider this model a good or bad model?<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
  <strong>b. ROC - Receiver Operating Characteristics <br></strong> This type of graph is called a <strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic</strong> curve (or ROC curve). It is a plot of the true positive rate against the false-positive rate for the different possible cut points of a diagnostic test.  A ROC curve is a useful tool because it only focuses on how well the model was able to distinguish between classes with the help of the Area Under the Curve or AUC. &#34;AUC&#39;s can help represent the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly selected positive observation higher than a randomly selected negative observation&#34;[1]. However, for models where one of the classes occurs rarely, a high AUC could provide a false sense that the model is correctly predicting the results. This is where the notion of precision and recall become essential.  The ROC curve below shows the stats on validation data and the best Accuracy, MCC, and F1 values[2]:<br><img style="width: 545.00px" src="img/710bc5b5cd6edb4e.jpg"><br><br>  If a test set was provided for the experiment, then click on the <strong>Validation Metrics</strong> button below the graph to view these stats on test data.  This ROC gives an Area Under the Curve or AUC of <strong>.8535</strong>. The AUC tells us that the model can separate the survivor class with an accuracy of <strong>85.35</strong>%.  Learn more about the ROC Curve on the next self-paced course:<a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-financial-focus" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis - Financial Focus</a>.<br><br>  <strong>c. Prec-Recall: Precision-Recall Graph<br></strong> Prec-Recall is a complementary tool to ROC curves, especially when the dataset has a significant skew. The Prec-Recall curve plots the precision or positive predictive value (y-axis) versus sensitivity or true positive rate (x-axis) for every possible classification threshold. At a high level, we can think of precision as a measure of exactness or quality of the results while recall as a measure of completeness or quantity of the results obtained by the model. Prec-Recall measures the relevance of the results obtained by the model.  The Prec-Recall plot below shows the Precision-Recall curve on validation data along with the best Accuracy, MCC, and F1 values. The area under this curve is called AUCPR.<br><img style="width: 545.00px" src="img/e3b49120a0f0a36d.jpg"><br><br> If a test set was provided for the experiment, then click on the <strong>Validation Metrics</strong> button below the graph to view these stats on test data.  Similarly to the ROC curve, when we look at the area under the curve of the Prec-Recall Curve of AUCPR, we get a value of <strong>.8230(accuracy of 82.30%)</strong>.  Learn more about the Precision-Recall Graph on the next self-paced course: <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-financial-focus" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis - Financial Focus</a>.<br>  <br><strong>d. Cumulative Lift Chart <br></strong> This chart shows lift stats on validation data. For example, &#34;How many times more observations of the positive target class are in the top predicted 1%, 2%, 10%, etc. (cumulative) compared to selecting observations randomly?&#34; By definition, the Lift at 100% is 1.0. Lift can help answer the question of how much better you can expect to do with the predictive model compared to a random model (or no model). Lift is a measure of the effectiveness of a predictive model calculated as the ratio between the results obtained with a model and with a random model(or no model). In other words, the ratio of gain % to the random expectation % at a given quantile. The random expectation of the xth quantile is x%. Hover over a point in the Lift chart to view the quantile percentage and cumulative lift value for that point.<br><img style="width: 545.00px" src="img/dfd6eb782fa97e0d.jpg"><br><br> If a test set was provided for the experiment, then click on the Validation Metrics button below the graph to view these stats on test data.  Learn more about the Cumulative Lift Chart on the next self-paced course: <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-financial-focus" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis - Financial Focus</a>.<br>  <br><strong>e. Cumulative Gains Chart<br></strong> Gain and Lift charts measure a classification model&#39;s effectiveness by looking at the ratio between the results obtained with a trained model versus a random model(or no model)[3]. The Gain and Lift charts help us evaluate the performance of the classifier as well as answer questions such as what percentage of the dataset captured has a positive response as a function of the selected percentage of a sample. Additionally, we can explore how much better we can expect to do with a built model than a random model(or no model)[4].  For better visualization, the percentage of positive responses compared to a selected percentage sample uses Cumulative Gains and Quantile.  In the Gains Chart below, the x-axis shows the percentage of cases from the total number of cases in the test dataset, while the y-axis shows the percentage of positive outcomes or survivors in terms of quantiles.  The Cumulative Gains Chart below shows Gains stats on validation data. For example, &#34;What fraction of all observations of the positive target class are in the top predicted 1%, 2%, 10%, etc. (cumulative)?&#34; By definition, the Gains at 100% are 1.0.<br><img style="width: 545.00px" src="img/1754758bf53b9cb6.jpg"><br><br> If a test set was provided for the experiment, then click on the <strong>Validation Metrics</strong> button below the graph to view these stats on test data.  The Gains chart above tells us that when looking at the <strong>20%</strong> quantile, the model can positively identify <strong>~45%</strong> of the survivors compared to a random model(or no model), which would be able to positively identify about <strong>~20%</strong> of the survivors at the <strong>20%</strong> quantile.  Learn more about the Cumulative Gains Chart on the next self-paced course: <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-financial-focus" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis - Financial Focus</a>.<br>  <br><strong>f. Kolmogorov-Smirnov<br></strong> Kolmogorov-Smirnov or K-S measures classification models&#39; performance by measuring the degree of separation between positives and negatives for validation or test data[5]. &#34;The K-S is 100 if the scores partition the population into two separate groups in which one group contains all the positives and the other all the negatives. On the other hand, If the model cannot differentiate between positives and negatives, then it is as if the model selects cases randomly from the population. The K-S would be 0. In most classification models, the K-S will fall between 0 and 100, and the higher the value, the better the model is at separating the positive from negative cases.&#34; [6].  K-S or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov chart measures the degree of separation between positives and negatives for validation or test data.  Hover over a point in the chart to view the quantile percentage and Kolmogorov-Smirnov value for that point:<br><img style="width: 545.00px" src="img/d1ed2580c768e430.jpg"><br><br> If a test set was provided for the experiment, then click on the <strong>Validation Metrics</strong> button below the graph to view these stats on test data.  For the K-S chart above, if we look at the top <strong>60%</strong> of the data, the at-chance model (the dotted diagonal line) tells us that only <strong>60%</strong> of the data was successfully separated between positives and negatives (survived and did not survive). However, with the model, it was able to do <strong>.452</strong>, or about <strong>~45.2%</strong> of the cases were successfully separated between positives and negatives.  Learn more about the Kolmogorov-Smirnov graph on the next self-paced course: <a href="https://h2oai.github.io/tutorials/machine-learning-experiment-scoring-and-analysis-financial-focus" target="_blank">Machine Learning Experiment Scoring and Analysis - Financial Focus</a>.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 8: Machine Learning Interpretability Report for Non-Time-Series Experiments" duration="0">
        <p>For non-time-series experiments, Driverless AI  provides several visual explanations and reason codes for the trained Driverless AI model and its results. After the predictive model is finished, we can have access to this reason codes and visuals by generating an <strong>MLI Report</strong>. With that in mind, let us focus on the fourth step of the Driverless AI workflow: <strong>Interpret the model</strong>.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Generate MLI Report</strong>: In the <strong>Status Complete</strong> section, click <strong>Interpret this Model</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 355.00px" src="img/6447626632640bd.png">     </p>
<p>The Model Interpretation page is organized into three tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary</li>
<li>Interpretations using DAI Model (The DAI Model tab)</li>
<li>Interpretations using Surrogate Models (Surrogate Model Tab)</li>
<li>Interpretations using NLP Dataset (Dataset Tab)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the <strong>MLI Experiment is finished</strong> the following should appear:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dai-model" src="img/983f851cb4dfee1.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note:</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>a. Summary</strong> of MLI experiment. This page provides an overview of the interpretation, including the dataset and Driverless AI experiment (if available) that were used for the interpretation along with the feature space (original or transformed), target column, problem type, and k-Lime information:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="mli-report-page-1.jpg" src="img/7240f65d5fddda71.png"><img alt="mli-report-page-2.jpg" src="img/afaec6f68428c9aa.png"><img alt="mli-report-page-3.jpg" src="img/a29f15e9353f5acf.png"><img alt="mli-report-page-4.jpg" src="img/ec859d0d26980517.png"></p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> The DAI Model tab is organized into tiles for each interpretation method. To view a specific plot, click the tile for the plot that you want to view.</p>
<p>For binary classification and regression experiments, this tab includes Feature Importance and Shapley (not supported for RuleFit and TensorFlow models) plots for original and transformed features as well as Partial Dependence/ICE, Disparate Impact Analysis (DIA), Sensitivity Analysis, NLP Tokens and NLP LOCO (for text experiments), and Permutation Feature Importance (if the <code>autodoc_include_permutation_feature_importance</code> configuration option is enabled) plots.</p>
<p>For multiclass classification experiments, this tab includes Feature Importance and Shapley plots for original and transformed features:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Things to Note<br></em>  <strong>a. Sensitivity Analysis</strong> (or &#34;What if?&#34;) is a simple and powerful model debugging, explanation, fairness, and security tool. The idea behind Sensitivity Analysis is both direct and straightforward: Score your trained model on a single row, on multiple rows, or an entire dataset of potentially interesting simulated values and compare the model&#39;s new outcome to the predicted outcome on the original data.  Sensitivity analysis investigates whether model behavior and outputs remain stable when data is intentionally perturbed, or other changes are simulated in the data. Machine learning models can make dramatically different predictions for only minor changes in input variable values. For example, when looking at predictions that determine financial decisions, SA can help you understand the impact of changing the most important input variables and the impact of changing socially sensitive variables (such as Sex, Age, Race, etc.) in the model. If the model changes in reasonable and expected ways when important variable values are changed, this can enhance trust in the model. Similarly, if the model changes to sensitive variables have minimal impact on the model, this indicates fairness in the model predictions. Learn more about <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-8-lts/docs/userguide/interpret-non-ts.html#sensitivity-analysis" target="_blank">Sensitivity Analysis</a>.  To access it consider the following steps: click on the <strong>SA</strong> (Sensitivity Analysis) tile:  <img alt="sensitivity-analysis" src="img/325aa3605d13aeee.jpg"><br><br><strong>b. Disparate Impact Analysis:</strong> Disparate Impact Analysis is a technique that is used to evaluate fairness. Bias can be introduced to models during the process of collecting, processing, and labeling data—as a result, it is essential to determine whether a model is harming certain users by making a significant number of biased decisions.

This plot shows the Driverless AI <strong>original</strong> feature importance. Driverless AI feature importance is a measure of the contribution of an input variable to the overall predictions of the Driverless AI model.  To access it consider the following steps: click on the <strong>Original Feature Importance</strong> tile:  <img alt="original-feature-importance" src="img/986ff90cd21c616d.jpg"><br><br><strong>d.</strong> The <strong>Transformed Feature Importance</strong> chart is available for all models for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression experiments.  This plot shows the Driverless AI <strong>transformed</strong> feature importance. Driverless AI feature importance is a measure of the contribution of an input variable to the overall predictions of the Driverless AI model.  To access it consider the following steps: click on the <strong>Transformed Feature Importance</strong> tile:  <img alt="transformed-feature-importance" src="img/93dbdafd1b8aea88.jpg"><br><br><strong>e. Transformed Shapley</strong>  This plot is not available for RuleFit or TensorFlow models. For all other models, this plot is available for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression experiments.  Shapley explanations are a technique with credible theoretical support that presents consistent global and local variable contributions. Local numeric Shapley values are calculated by tracing single rows of data through a trained tree ensemble and aggregating the contribution of each input variable as the row of data moves through the trained ensemble. For regression tasks, Shapley values sum to the prediction of the Driverless AI model. For classification problems, Shapley values sum to the prediction of the Driverless AI model before applying the link function. Global Shapley values are the average of the absolute Shapley values over every row of a dataset.<br>  <strong>Notes</strong>:  <ul>
<li>Shapley values for transformed features are calculated by tracing individual rows of data through a trained tree ensemble and then aggregating the contribution of each input variable as the row of data moves through the trained ensemble. More information about Shapley for tree-based models is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06060.</li>

DAI Data Zip Archive</strong> - dia-explainer.zip<br><br><strong>g. DAI PD/ICE</strong>  This plot is available for binary classification and regression models.  Overlaying ICE plots onto partial dependence plots allow the comparison of the Driverless AI model&#39;s treatment of certain examples or individuals to the model&#39;s average predictions over the domain of an input variable of interest.  This plot shows the partial dependence when a variable is selected and the ICE values when a specific row is selected. Users may select a point on the graph to see the specific value at that point. Partial dependence (yellow) portrays the average prediction behavior of the Driverless AI model across the domain of an input variable along with +/- 1 standard deviation bands. ICE (grey) displays the prediction behavior for an individual row of data when an input variable is toggled across its domain. Currently, partial dependence and ICE plots are only available for the top ten most important original input variables. Categorical variables with 20 or more unique values are never included in these plots.  To learn about the <strong>Partial Dependence and ICE Technique</strong> go <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/userguide/interpret-understanding.html#partial-dependence-pdp-and-individual-conditional-expectation-ice" target="_blank">here</a>.

Naive Shapley</strong>  This plot is not available for RuleFit or TensorFlow models. For all other models, this plot is available for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression experiments.  Shapley values for original features are approximated from the accompanying Shapley values for transformed features with the Naive Shapley method. For example, if the transformed feature 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒1_𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒2 has a Shapley value of 0.5, then the Shapley value of the original features 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒1 and 𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒2 will be 0.25 each. Shapley values for original features can also be calculated with the Kernel Explainer method, which uses a special weighted linear regression to compute the importance of each feature. This can be enabled by using the recipe Original Kernel Shap explainer. More information about Kernel SHAP is available <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>A <strong>surrogate model</strong> is a data mining and engineering technique in which a generally simpler model is used to explain another, usually more complex, model or phenomenon. For example, the decision tree surrogate model is trained to predict the predictions of the more complex Driverless AI model using the original model inputs. The trained surrogate model enables a heuristic understanding (i.e., not a mathematically precise understanding) of the mechanisms of the highly complex and nonlinear Driverless AI model.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> The Surrogate Model tab is organized into tiles for each interpretation method. To view a specific plot, click the tile for the plot that you want to view. For binary classification and regression experiments, this tab includes K-LIME/LIME-SUP and Decision Tree plots as well as Feature Importance, Partial Dependence, and LOCO plots for the Random Forest surrogate model.
