        <p><strong>Machine Learning Model Deployment</strong> is the process of making your models available in production environments, so they can be used to make predictions for other software systems. Before model deployment, <strong>feature engineering</strong> occurs in preparing data that will later be used to train a model. Driverless AI <strong>Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML)</strong> combines the best feature engineering and one or more <strong>machine learning models</strong> into a scoring pipeline. The <strong>scoring pipeline</strong> is used to score or predict data when given new test data. The scoring pipeline comes in two flavors. The first scoring pipeline is a <strong>Model Object, Optimized(MOJO) Scoring Pipeline,</strong> which is a standalone, low-latency model object designed to be easily embeddable in production environments. The second scoring pipeline is a Python Scoring Pipeline, which has a heavy footprint that is all Python and uses the latest libraries of Driverless AI to allow for executing custom scoring recipes.</p>
<p>For this self-paced course, we will continue using the prebuilt experiment: <strong>Model_deployment_HydraulicSystem.</strong>  The Driverless AI  experiment is a classifier model that classifies whether the <strong>cooling condition</strong> of a <strong>Hydraulic System Test Rig</strong> is 3, 20, or 100. By looking at the <strong>cooling condition,</strong> we can predict whether the Hydraulic Cooler operates <strong>close to total failure</strong>, <strong>reduced efficiency</strong>, or <strong>full efficiency</strong>.</p>

<p>The Hydraulic System Test Rig data for this self-paced course comes from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems#" target="_blank"><strong>UCI Machine Learning Repository: Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems Data Set</strong></a>. The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit connected via the oil tank [1]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows, and temperatures. The condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump, and accumulator) is quantitatively varied. The data set contains raw process sensor data (i.e., without feature extraction), structured as matrices (tab-delimited) with the rows representing the cycles and the columns the data points within a cycle.</p>
<p>Hydraulic System Test Rigs are used to test Aircraft Equipment components, Automotive Applications, and more [2]. A Hydraulic Test Rig can test a range of flow rates that can achieve different pressures with the ability to heat and cool while simulating testing under different conditions [3]. Testing the pressure, the volume flow, and the temperature is possible by Hydraulic Test Rig sensors and a digital display. The display panel alerts the user when certain testing criteria are met while displaying either a green or red light [3]. Further, a filter blockage panel indicator is integrated into the panel to ensure the Hydraulic Test Rig&#39;s oil is maintained [3]. In the case of predicting cooling conditions for a Hydraulic System, when the cooling condition is low, our prediction will tell us that the cooling of the Hydraulic System is close to total failure, and we may need to look into replacing the cooling filtration solution soon.</p>

<p>Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Connect to EC2 instance using SSH
ssh -i $H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM ubuntu@$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE
</code></pre>
<p>After connecting to your EC2 instance, your terminal should look as follows:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="ssh-into-ec2" src="img/10cc69540c7f7ace.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Set the Driverless AI License Key in EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>While connected to the EC2 instance, set the Driverless AI License Key as a permanent environment variable so that you can use the Python scoring pipeline.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">echo &#39;export DRIVERLESS_AI_LICENSE_KEY=&#34;&lt;license-key&gt;&#34;&#39; &gt;&gt; $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Install the Requirements in EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>We will install the required packages on our EC2 instance:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Install the Requirements
# Make all packages available on the EC2 instance
sudo apt-get -y update

# Install Python 3.6 and related packages
sudo apt-get -y install python3.6 python-virtualenv python3.6-dev python3-pip python3-dev python3-virtualenv

# Install OpenBLAS for linear algebra calculations
sudo apt-get -y install libopenblas-dev

# Install Unzip for access to individual files in the scoring pipeline folder

  libssl-dev libtool make pkg-config libboost-all-dev ant
wget https://github.com/apache/thrift/archive/0.10.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf 0.10.0.tar.gz
cd thrift-0.10.0
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

# Refresh runtime after installing thrift
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done, you can exit the <code>thrift-0.10.0</code> directory.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create Environment Directory Structure in EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>Next, we recommend creating the following environment directory structure in your EC2 instance since it will make it easier to follow along with the rest of the deployment self-paced courses. If you already have it from the other self-paced courses, you can skip this step. To create the environment directory, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Create directory structure for model deployment projects (covers MOJO and Python)
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/common/license
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/testData/{test-batch-data,test-real-time-data}
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/{mojo-scoring-pipeline/{java-runtime/java/mojo2-java-runtime,cpp-runtime/{c/mojo2-c-runtime/{linux,macos-x,ibm-powerpc},r-wrapper/mojo2-r-runtime/{linux,macos-x,ibm-powerpc},python-wrapper/mojo2-py-runtime/{linux,macos-x,ibm-powerpc}}},python-scoring-pipeline}
mkdir -p $HOME/model-deployment/apps
tree model-deployment
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="env-dir-structure-ubuntu" src="img/18da1abf9283b50c.png"></p>
<p>Now we have the environment directory structure built. Next, we will connect to a Driverless AI EC2 instance to download a python scoring pipeline built for the Hydraulic sensor data.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Download Python Scoring Pipeline to Local Machine</h2>
<p>Download MOJO Scoring Pipeline</p>
<p>1. If you have not downloaded the MOJO Scoring Pipeline, consider the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start a new Two-Hour Driverless AI Test Drive session in <a href="https://aquarium.h2o.ai/login" target="_blank">Aquarium</a>.</li>
<li>In your Driverless AI instance, click on the <strong>Experiments</strong> section.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Experiments</strong> section, click on the following experiment: <strong>Model_deployment_HydraulicSystem</strong></li>
<li>On the STATUS: COMPLETE section on the experiment page, click <strong>DOWNLOAD PYTHON SCORING PIPELINE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="download-python-scoring-pipeline" src="img/e330efd3d8630d68.png"></p>
<p>When finished, come back to this self-paced course.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Move Local Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>The Python Scoring Pipeline scorer.zip was downloaded to the Downloads folder on the local machine. We need to move it to our EC2 instance. Open a new terminal on your local machine, then run the following command:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Move Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 instance
scp -i $H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM $HOME/Downloads/scorer.zip ubuntu@$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:/home/ubuntu
</code></pre>
<p>It may take up to 14 minutes for the transfer to be completed.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="move-py-scoring-pipeline-to-ec2" src="img/69f00a7d1acc6522.png"></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that you need to have the variables <code>H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM</code> and <code>H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE</code> stored in your local machine for the above command to work.</p>
<p>Go to the terminal in which you are already connected to your EC2 instance. Move the <strong>scorer.zip</strong> file to <code>python-scoring-pipeline/</code> folder and then extract it:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/python-scoring-pipeline/
mv $HOME/scorer.zip .
unzip scorer.zip
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create Virtual Environments in EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>In your EC2 instance, create two virtual environments: <strong>env</strong>, and <strong>tcp_client_env.</strong> Then install all of the required libraries. Any time we wish to run one of our python scripts (<strong>example.py, custom_tcp_client.py</strong>) we will activate the appropriate environment.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Move to the scoring-pipeline folder, Create virtual environments in it
cd scoring-pipeline

# Create virtual environment example env and install required libraries
virtualenv -p python3.6 env
source env/bin/activate
# Install gitdb2 and gitdb into env
pip install --upgrade gitdb2==2.0.6 gitdb==0.6.4
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate

# Create virtual environment tcp_client_env and install required libraries
virtualenv -p python3.6 tcp_client_env
source tcp_client_env/bin/activate
# Install client dependencies
pip install -r client_requirements.txt -c full_constraints.txt
thrift --gen py scoring.thrift
deactivate
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may see error messages related to h2o during the install process, this is normal, and the install will still be successful.</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">botocore 1.19.19 requires urllib3&lt;1.27,&gt;=1.25.4; python_version != &#34;3.4&#34;, but you&#39;ll have urllib3 1.24.3 which is incompatible.

h2oaicore 1.x.x requires wheel==0.33.4, but you&#39;ll have wheel 0.35.1 which is incompatible.
</code></pre>
<p>With the environment set up for the <strong>Python Scoring Pipeline</strong>, we are ready to classify the Hydraulic System cooling condition from the Hydraulic test data. Still, first, we will focus on learning the Python Scoring Pipeline concepts.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Task 2: Scoring Pipeline Deployment in Python Runtime Concepts" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Python Scoring Pipeline Files</h2>
<p>After downloading the Python Scoring Pipeline, the <strong>scoring-pipeline</strong> folder comes with many files. The wheel file that is needed to execute the Python Scoring Pipeline is the <strong>scoring_h2oai_experiment_6a77d0a4_6a25_11ea_becf_0242ac110002-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl</strong>, which is a library that we use to import the <strong>Scorer</strong> from. The <strong>Scorer</strong> is a class we use to do interactive or batch scoring on data. There are Python scripts in the folder that help with executing the scoring pipeline directly in Python, on an HTTP server and a TCP server. They include <strong>example.py, http_server.py,</strong> and <strong>tcp_server.py.</strong> In the Python Scoring Pipeline, we have an HTTP scoring service and a TCP scoring service. These two scoring services are independent and mutually exclusive.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Embedding Python Scoring Pipeline into Python Runtime</h2>
<p>To run the Python <strong>example.py</strong> script, there is the helper shell script <strong>run_example.sh.</strong> When the Python <strong>example.py</strong> is executed, it executes the Python scoring pipeline directly in Python and does various types of scoring on the test data. The Python <strong>example.py</strong> does interactive scoring in which it uses the <strong>scorer.score([...])</strong> method to score one row at a time. Additionally, the Python <strong>example.py</strong> does batch scoring in which it uses <strong>scorer.score_batch(dataframe</strong> or <strong>datatable)</strong> to score a frame of data. You can think of a frame as a batch of rows. Batch scoring is faster than interactive scoring. The Python <strong>example.py</strong> does batch scoring on a Pandas dataframe and a Datatable. In the Datatable part of the Python <strong>example.py,</strong> Datatable saves the initial test data into a <strong>test.csv</strong> and the predictions into a <strong>preds.csv.</strong> To help in interpreting the model&#39;s predictions for individual observations (rows) and batches of observations (frames), the Python <strong>example.py</strong> also obtains per-feature prediction contributions per row and per frame by setting the <strong>pred_contribs</strong> flag to <strong>True</strong> in the <strong>scorer.score([...], pred_contribs=True).</strong> The Python <strong>example.py</strong> also performs feature transformations without scoring to enrich the dataset by using <strong>Scorer.fit_transform_batch()</strong> to fit the feature engineering pipeline on the given training frame, validation frame, and optionally on the test frame.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline to a Server via Scoring Service</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Scoring Pipeline Deployment To an HTTP Server</h3>
<p>The HTTP scoring service has two functions: start the HTTP scoring service and get prediction results back by giving it data. To start the HTTP scoring service, run the Python <strong>http_server.py</strong> by executing the helper shell script <strong>run_http_server.sh.</strong> To use the HTTP scoring service to send data and get predictions results back over <strong>JSON-RPC 2.0 calls</strong>, run the helper shell script <strong>run_http_client.sh</strong>. When the <strong>http_server.py</strong> is executed, it deploys the Python scoring pipeline on an HTTP server, making the scoring pipeline&#39;s modules available to be called through remote procedure calls (RPC). Once the client makes the JSON-RPC 2.0 call powered by Tornado, data is sent to the HTTP server with a request for the Python scorer to make predictions on the data using <strong>scorer.score()</strong> method. Then the prediction results are returned to the client. Predictions can be made on individual rows (row-by-row) known as interactive scoring or on frames (multiple rows) known as batch scoring.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Scoring Pipeline Deployment To a TCP Server</h3>
<p>The TCP scoring service has two functions: start the scoring TCP scoring service and get prediction results back by giving it data. The TCP scoring service provides high-performance RPC calls by way of Apache Thrift using a binary wire protocol. To start the TCP scoring service, run the Python <strong>tcp_server.py</strong> by executing the helper shell script <strong>run_tcp_server.sh</strong>. To use the TCP scoring service to send data and get prediction results over high-performance RPC calls, run the helper shell script <strong>run_tcp_client.sh</strong>. When the <strong>tcp_server.py</strong> is executed, it deploys the Python scoring pipeline on a TCP server, making the scoring pipeline&#39;s modules available to be called through remote procedure calls (RPC). Once the client makes the RPC call powered by the thrift and h2oai_scoring libraries, data is sent to the TCP server with a request for the Python scorer to make predictions on the data using the <strong>scorer.score()</strong> method. Then, the prediction results are returned to the client. Predictions can be made on individual rows (row-by-row) known as interactive scoring or on frames (multiple rows) known as batch scoring.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Task 3: Interactive and Batch Scoring via Embedded Deployment" duration="0">
        <p>You will execute the Python Scoring Pipeline using Python directly, HTTP scoring service, and TCP scoring service to do batch scoring and interactive scoring on data.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Interactive and Batch Scoring via Run Python Example</h2>
<p>You will run the <strong>example.py</strong> script that came with the scoring-pipeline folder. This script uses the Python scorer to do interactive scoring using <code>scorer.score(row)</code> and batch scoring using <code>scorer.score_batch(frame)</code> for the Hydraulic System cooling condition on the Hydraulic sensor data. Additionally, this script also transforms a dataset by fitting the feature engineering pipeline on the data and gets per-feature prediction contributions, also known as Shapley values.</p>
<p>Since we already set our Driverless AI license key as an environment variable in our EC2 instance, we can run <strong>example.py</strong>:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Activate virtual environment env to run python example.py
source env/bin/activate
python example.py
</code></pre>
<p>The output should be similar to the following, but columns and predictions will match the data in your scoring pipeline:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="scoring-data-example-py-1" src="img/881a3f76edea3b78.png"><img alt="scoring-data-example-py-2" src="img/549f63c35820d9fa.png"><img alt="scoring-data-example-py-3" src="img/a0bf1944e79ae9ec.png"><img alt="scoring-data-example-py-4" src="img/2748ad8caf1a4421.png"></p>
<p>As you can see in the output above, after running the <strong>example.py</strong> file, we could retrieve different types of predictions for our Hydraulic dataset. We can see scores per row, frame, feature prediction contribution for row, transformed frames, column names, and transformed column names.</p>
<p>After reviewing these outputs, you can deactivate the virtual environment as we will move on to the next task.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 4: Interactive and Batch Scoring via Server Deployment" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 HTTP Server</h2>
<p>To deploy the Python Scoring Pipeline to the EC2 HTTP server, run the following command to start the HTTP server and execute the Python Scoring Pipeline on it:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Activates the http_server_env, starts the HTTP server and executes the Python Scoring Pipeline
# and deactivates virtual environment when stopping the server.
bash run_http_server.sh
</code></pre>
<p>After running the command above, a virtual environment with all the requirements will be created. Once this is done, you will see the following:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="run-http-server-sh" src="img/cf469907f5a76ef3.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Get Predictions using Local HTTP Client</h2>
<p>The HTTP scoring service is now listening on port 9090; we will use an HTTP client local to the HTTP server to get predictions. In the Python Scoring Pipeline folder, we will use <strong>run_http_client.sh</strong>, which executes multiple example json requests for interactive scoring (individual rows), batch scoring (multiple rows), getting input columns, transformed columns, and target labels.</p>
<p>Open another terminal to connect to your EC2 instance; then navigate to the <strong>scoring-pipeline</strong> folder and then execute the script <strong>run_http_client.sh</strong>:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Connect to EC2 instance using SSH
ssh -i $H2O_DAI_SCORING_PEM ubuntu@$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE

# Change to scoring-pipeline folder
cd $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/python-scoring-pipeline/scoring-pipeline
bash run_http_client.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The output should be similar to the following, but the Hydraulic System cooling condition classification shown in the json responses will match the data in your scoring pipeline:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="http-client-get-scores" src="img/52b5945d353a93f4.png"></p>
<p>This classification output is the interactive and batch scoring done for our Hydraulic System cooling condition. You should receive classification probabilities for <code>cool_cond_y.3</code>, <code>cool_cond_y.20</code>, and <code>cool_cond_y.100</code>. The <code>3</code> means the Hydraulic cooler is close to operating at total failure, <code>20</code> means it is operating at reduced efficiency, and <code>100</code> means it is operating at full efficiency.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Get Predictions using Remote HTTP Client</h2>
<p>Alternatively, we will use a remote HTTP client to connect to the HTTP server on port 9090 to get a prediction, feature column names, and Shapley values from the Python Scoring Pipeline.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s use the remote HTTP client to do interactive scoring to get the classification for the Hydraulic System cooling condition for an individual row. Open another terminal from your local machine, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">curl http://$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:9090/rpc --header &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; --data @- &lt;&lt;EOF

    }
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>The output should show a score for the Hydraulic System cooling condition of an individual row.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="remote-http-client-get-scores-1" src="img/5a8fe8088c4d7fa9.png"></p>
<p>By looking at the predictions, we can see that the highest probability belongs to cool_cond_y.100, which means that we are predicting that the hydraulic system is operating at full efficiency.</p>
<p>Next, we will use the remote HTTP client to get feature column names for an individual row, so when we retrieve the Shapley values, we know which value is which column. Run the following command from your local machine:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">echo &#34;Get the transformed columns&#34;
curl http://$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:9090/rpc --header &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; --data @- &lt;&lt;EOF
{
 &#34;id&#34;:1,
 &#34;method&#34;:&#34;get_transformed_column_names&#34;,
 &#34;params&#34;:{}
}
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>The output should show the featured column names for an individual row.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="remote-http-client-get-scores-2" src="img/931c0d6cad912563.png"></p>
<p>We will use the remote HTTP client to get the Shapley values (also known as per-feature prediction contributions) from an individual row. This call is the same as we did for getting a prediction on an individual row, but this time we include the parameter <code>&#34;pred_contribs&#34;: true</code>. Run the following command from your local machine:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">curl http://$H2O_DAI_SCORING_INSTANCE:9090/rpc --header &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; --data @- &lt;&lt;EOF

<p>You just learned how to perform interactive scoring and batch scoring using the HTTP scoring service. Next, we will deploy the Python Scoring Pipeline to a TCP server that will run on our EC2 instance. So, go to your terminal where your HTTP server is running on EC2, then press <code>control + C</code> to stop the HTTP server.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploy Python Scoring Pipeline to EC2 TCP Server</h2>
<p>To deploy the Python Scoring Pipeline to the EC2 TCP server, go to the terminal that was running the HTTP server on your EC2 instance, run the following command to generate the Thrift bindings once, start the TCP server and execute the Python Scoring Pipeline on it:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash"># Activates tcp_server_env, starts TCP server and executes Python Scoring
# Pipeline on it, deactivates virtual environment when stopping server
bash run_tcp_server.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, the line above will create a new environment with all the requirements. Once this is done, you will see the following:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="run-tcp-server" src="img/df0c9199fc0712ba.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Get Predictions using Local TCP Client</h2>
<p>The TCP scoring service is now listening on port 9090; we will use a TCP client local to the TCP server to get predictions. In the Python Scoring Pipeline folder, we will create a <strong>custom_tcp_client.py</strong>, which uses <strong>thrift</strong> and <strong>h2oai_scoring</strong> libraries to enable the TCP client to use the Python <strong>scorer</strong> methods through the TCP scoring service.</p>
<p>With the <strong>TCP client</strong> having access to the <strong>scorer</strong> methods, we will use the <strong>client.score(row)</strong> method to do interactive scoring, <strong>client.get_column_names()</strong> to get input columns, the <strong>client.get_transformed_column_names()</strong> to get feature column names, and <strong>client.get_target_labels()</strong> to get target labels.</p>
<p>Go to the terminal where you ran your <strong>local HTTP client</strong> on your EC2 instance, run the following command to create the <strong>custom_tcp_client.py</strong> script:</p>
<pre><code language="language-bash" class="language-bash">cd $HOME/model-deployment/common/hydraulic/python-scoring-pipeline/scoring-pipeline

        <h2 is-upgraded>Execute Scoring Pipeline for a New Dataset</h2>
<p>There are various challenges you could do. You could do something that helps you in your daily life or job. Maybe there is a dataset you are working with; you could reproduce the steps we did above, but for your dataset, build a new experiment and execute your Python scoring pipeline to do batch scoring or interactive scoring.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Embed Scoring Pipeline into Existing Program</h2>
<p>Another challenge could be to use the existing Python scoring pipeline we executed: instead of using the examples we shared above, integrate the scoring pipeline into an existing Java, Python, or C++ program using the TCP or HTTP scoring service.</p>
