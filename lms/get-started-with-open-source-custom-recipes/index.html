        <p>At H2O.ai, we believe that every company can and should be an AI company. This concept is fundamental for the future of every business and organization today. As you embark on this AI journey to make your own AI, we would like you to explore the key considerations and the technology that will make your own AI a possibility.</p>
<p>To make your own AI with an automated machine learning platform, the platform needs to be open and extensible. An open and extensible platform allows data scientists to influence the automatic machine learning optimization process and for the process to consider additional feature engineering, scorers metrics, and modeling algorithms. Data scientists can add their insights, customizations, and domain expertise to build the most accurate models for each use case. Driverless AI uses the concept of recipes to optimize the machine learning process, and with Driverless AI 1.7.0 and later versions, users can add and develop custom recipes.</p>
<p>This self-paced course will cover what a recipe is, the different types of recipes available, and how to upload existing recipes to Driverless AI through the URL option. The three types of custom recipes that we will cover are transformer, scorer, and model.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 1: Introduction to Driverless AI Bring Your Own Recipe" duration="0">
        <p>H2O Driverless AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform for automatic machine learning. Driverless AI automates some of the most tedious and challenging data science and machine learning tasks such as feature engineering, algorithm selection, model validation, model tuning, model selection, model explanation, model documentation, and model deployment. It aims to achieve the highest predictive accuracy, comparable to expert data scientists, but in a much shorter time thanks to end-to-end automation. Driverless AI&#39;s current scope does not include extensive data manipulation or augmentation before starting an experiment; hence, most of the data preparation needs to be done before loading the data.</p>
<p>Driverless AI uses an experiment to learn from your data and build an end-to-end scoring pipeline for productionalizing a model. The experiment process and the final pipeline are made up of building blocks or recipes. These recipes are Python code snippets. Recipes have the following types: ML algorithms, feature engineering (transformers), scorers, and data. In Driverless AI 1.7.0, we added support for BYOR (Bring Your Own Recipe). With BYOR, you can use your own recipes in combination with or instead of all built-in recipes. This allows you to further influence the Driverless AI Automatic ML pipeline in addition to out-of-the-box control over the optimization choices that Driverless AI makes.</p>
<p>Recipes can be uploaded into Driverless AI at runtime without restarting the platform, just like a plugin. Data scientists at H2O have created and curated approximately 150 open-source recipes that can be used as-is or as templates and can also be expanded.</p>
<p>Existing recipes include templates for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transformers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scorers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Models</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the self-paced course&#39;s remaining tasks, we will be describing the various types of templates and how to use them. Please note that we will cover the <strong>Data</strong> recipes in another self-paced course.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>How do recipes work in Driverless AI?</h2>
<p>During the training of a supervised machine learning modeling pipeline, Driverless AI can use the custom recipes or code snippets as building blocks, independent or in combination with all built-in recipes that come with Driverless AI. The custom recipes act the same as if they were written by H2O.ai. It&#39;s the same python template and backend, so there is no performance penalty.</p>
<p>Below is a diagram of how recipes work in Driverless AI and how the Automatic Model Optimization process is extended:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dai-byor-how-it-works" src="img/19c0e46d6cf96f0d.png"></p>
<p>The image below is a deeper dive into the <strong>BYOR</strong> architecture for a multi-class problem:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dai-byor-architecture-diagram-1" src="img/eed8ff3f17393b90.png"></p>
<p>The diagram above focuses on the parts of Driverless AI that are relevant to the <strong>BYOR</strong> architecture.  The diagram is the architecture representing a multi-class problem. Binary classification and regression problems are also supported. Please note that Automatic Visualization and Machine Learning Interpretability are not covered in this diagram.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What is the role of recipes in ML?</h2>
<p><strong>BYOR</strong> allows Data Scientists to bring their own recipes or leverage the existing, open-source recipes to manipulate, augment, and optimize their data. In this way, the expertise of those creating and using the recipes is leveraged to focus on domain-specific functions to build customizations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Where can you find the H2O open-source recipes?</h2>
<p>The curated open-source recipes currently reside in the following GitHub repository:</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>About the Dataset</h2>
<p>This self-paced course will use the customer churn telco dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The dataset has information about customers of a telecommunications company. Some of the features included are customer demographic location, length of the account, and customer call history. We will be predicting customer churn.</p>
<p>[1] <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset" target="_blank">Churn in Telcom&#39;s dataset</a></p>
<p>This dataset set has 3333 customers(rows) and 21 columns representing each customer&#39;s telephone plan&#39;s attributes.</p>

<p>When a dataset is selected for an experiment, Driverless AI optimizes its settings by selecting the best Scorer, Model(s), and Transformers for the dataset. However, this does not mean we cannot import other scorers, models, or transformers to see if we can further optimize our model. In this task, we will be importing a transformer recipe to see how the features in the feature engineering change.</p>
<p>Now we will import a recipe to add together related numeric features such as day minutes, evening minutes, and night minutes. Driverless AI doesn&#39;t add three or more columns automatically, so we will add a recipe that will do this for us. We will see if this new feature ends up in the top features used by our final Driverless AI model.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Import a Transformer Recipe</h2>
<p>The goal of importing the new transformer recipe is to see if we can further optimize our baseline model. To do this, we are going to take our baseline experiment and import the <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/driverlessai-recipes/blob/rel-1.9.1/transformers/numeric/sum.py" target="_blank">sum.py transformer</a></p>

</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="exp2-load-custom-recipe-transformer-raw-url" src="img/871529b68c4a1d9c.png"></p>
<p>7. There will be a message updating you on the status of loading the recipe; then, the Expert Experiment Settings page will re-appear.</p>
<p>8. On the <strong>Expert Experiment Settings</strong> find <strong>Recipes</strong> and click on it:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="exp2-expert-settings-recipes" src="img/3ddd56547d725a28.png"></p>
<p>9. Click on <strong>Select Values</strong> under <strong>Include Specific Transformer</strong>. We will verify that the transformer we loaded did indeed load.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="exp2-expert-settings-transformer-select-values" src="img/e91f6823426bf517.png"></p>
<p>10. Type <code>SumTransformer</code> on the search bar. If the Transformer was loaded correctly, then it will appear as shown below, highlighted, meaning that Driverless AI will use it. Make sure your <strong>SumTransformer</strong> is checked, and click <strong>Done</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="exp2-sum-transformer" src="img/377774be5df11db8.png"></p>
<p>11. Select <strong>Save</strong> on the <strong>Expert Experiment Settings</strong> page.</p>
<p>12. Verify that the transformer is in the experiment; on the Experiments page, look under &#34;What do these settings mean?&#34; &gt; &#34;Interpretability,&#34; and you should see the custom transformer as <strong>Sum.</strong> Once you are ready, Select <strong>Launch Experiment</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="exp2-check-transformer" src="img/797013434b3bac50.png"></p>
<p>13. When the experiment is completed, you will see a similar summary page:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="exp2-summary" src="img/c4a54f4635aab9af.png"></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Variable Importance: You might see a few features starting with &#34;SUM;&#34; those are the features from the custom transformer. In our case, we got one feature starting with &#34;SUM.&#34;</p>
<p>As you can see, the AUC slightly improved, and Driverless AI recognized the interaction among several features and added them together by using our custom transformer. Though sometimes, Driverless AI uses the transformer, it depends on the Data sampling it uses when running the experiment. If you want to see how the recipe will improve the AUC, you can go back to recipes and only select the transformer. We will further discuss the results at the end of task 6.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Task 6: Comparing Final Model Results" duration="0">
        <p>So far, we ran four experiments, a baseline, and the baseline with three different types of recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driverless AI Baseline Model</li>
<li>Transformer</li>
<li>Scorer</li>
<li>Model</li>
</ul>
<p>We will compare the results of all the experiments through the <strong>Projects</strong> feature, which allows us to compare the final models for each experiment.</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Projects</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="projects-select" src="img/8b96decf41e5d52.png"></p>
<p>2. Select <strong>+New Project</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Enter the following under:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
<pre><code language="language-text" class="language-text">Customer Churn Recipe Comparison
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<pre><code language="language-text" class="language-text">Comparison of customer churn experiments using various recipes.
</code></pre>
<p>4. Select <strong>Create a New Project</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="create-project" src="img/5fcd7a5b67e4b9b4.png"></p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>+Link Experiment</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="projects-link-experiment" src="img/6d63c66599fce241.png"></p>
<p>6. Select <strong>Exp 1 - Baseline</strong> by clicking on the Model:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="project-select-exp1" src="img/e6da37d667f9e150.png"></p>
<p>7. Repeat step 6 for the remaining models (2, 3, and 4). The <strong>Project</strong> page should look similar to the one below:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="projects-all-models-selected" src="img/72f9b9c63f785dad.png"></p>
<p>8. Select Exp 1, 2, and 4 to compare by clicking on the select box to the left of each model, and then on <strong>Compare 3 Items</strong>:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="project-select-models-to-compare" src="img/7f1983f96f9ce0aa.png"></p>
<p>9. A similar page will appear with the three model results:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="project-model-comparison1" src="img/2078f6373afcaca.png"></p>
<p>Confusion Matrices for each of the selected models:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="project-model-comparison-matrix" src="img/6b351159bf9f52ed.png"></p>
<p>From the confusion matrices shown above, we can understand how the models with the custom recipes improved. The Model recipe yielded a lower misclassification error of <strong>5.43%</strong> than the baseline misclassification error, <strong>7.56%</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Formula: Misclassification (all <strong>incorrect</strong> / all) = (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)</li>
<li>The misclassification percentage for the Model recipe is:</li>
</ul>
<p>Misclassification = (71 + 110) / (2779 + 373 + 71 + 110)</p>
<p>Misclassification = 181 / 3,333 = 0.0543 = <strong>5.43%</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The misclassification percentage for the Baseline is:</li>
</ul>
<p>Misclassification = (145 + 103) / (380 + 2705 + 145 + 103)</p>
<p>Misclassification = 248 / 3,333 = 0.0744 = <strong>7.44%</strong></p>
<p>However, since we are working with a slightly imbalanced dataset, we need to take a closer look at the confusion matrices. We see that by using the custom recipes, the models started predicting more <strong>False</strong> labels correctly; in other words, we see more <strong>True Negatives</strong>; thus, we have a smaller misclassification error for the <strong>False</strong> class. On the other hand, we can see that the models with the recipes slightly underperformed when predicting the True class. For that reason, we see that the misclassification error for the True label is slightly better for the baseline. In this case, if we care more about the overall misclassification error, then we can see that the Model recipes are our best option. However, if we wanted to get better results for our True class, we will need to try to run another experiment while combining our different recipes.</p>
<p>ROC Curves for each model selected:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="project-model-comparison2" src="img/2e0c6eb41aa5e71f.png"></p>
<p>We can see that when we used the Transformer recipe, the model had better AUC with an accuracy of <strong>0.9313</strong> compared to <code>Exp 1 - Baseline,</code> which had an accuracy of <strong>0.9310</strong>. In <code>Exp 4 - Model</code>, the AUC also improved, compared to the Baseline model, and had the best accuracy, <strong>0.9463</strong>, compared to the other models. When looking at the variable importance, we see that all three experiments had &#34;Day Charge&#34; as the most important variable. In Exp 1 and 2, we see that &#34;CustServ Calls&#34; was the second most important variable, while for Exp 4, the second most important variable was &#34;Day Mins.&#34; For Exp 2, the variable starting with &#34;SUM&#34; has a relative importance of 0.41; this value might not seem too high, but we can see that this variable is somewhat helping the model get a higher AUC than the other experiments.</p>
