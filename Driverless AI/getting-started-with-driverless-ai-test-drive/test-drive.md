## Driverless AI Test Drive 

**Driverless AI Test Drive** is a two-hour lab session that exists in H2O's Aquarium. Aquarium is the H2O cloud environment providing software access for workshops, conferences, and training.

All Aquarium labs have a specific **Lab Duration*** to complete the lab. **All Driverless AI Test Drive Lab sessions will terminate after two-hours. No work will be saved!**. However, you can retake the lab multiple times.

If you are new to Driverless AI we highly recommend you start with the **Test Drive**!

**Note**: **Aquarium’s Driverless AI Test Drive lab has a license key built-in, so you don’t need to request one to use it**.
