# New Documentation Site

What is the purpose of these docs?

## Running this site

This site was generated using Makersaurus, which is a very thin wrapper around Facebook's Docusaurus. You can write documentation in the typical way, using markdown files located in the `docs` folder and registering those files in `sidebars.js`. 

Use the following commands to run the generate the site and run it locally:

```
npx @h2oai/makersaurus@latest gen
cd gen
npm install
npm start
```
